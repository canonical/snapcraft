name: project-variables
base: core22
version: "1.0.0"
summary: Test evaluation of project variables in keys.

# Description is a convenient key for testing project variables because it is freeform.
# Note that this test doesn't test project variables in override scriplets,
# since those variables are set in the build environment and are tested separately.
