summary: Strict confinement without staged python
description: |
  When we have a strict snap with no staged python the venv
  symlink must point to the interpreter provided by the base
  snap (which will appear as the root filesystem). The expected
  link for core24 is python3 -> /usr/bin/python3.12.
