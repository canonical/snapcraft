summary: Devmode confinement without staged python
description: |
  Devmode works like strict confinement and if we don't have a staged
  python interpreter the venv symlink must point to the interpreter
  provided by the base snap (which will appear as the root filesystem).
  The expected link for core24 is python3 -> /usr/bin/python3.12.
