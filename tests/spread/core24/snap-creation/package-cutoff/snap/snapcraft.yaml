# The parts defined here will be in conflict if the package-cutoff is not working;
# Without the cutoff, part-1's staging of libpng16-16 will pull in libc6, which
# will create a directory called "lib64/". part-2's python plugin will also create
# "lib64", but as a symlink to "lib". The regular directory and the symlink will
# then be in conflict and the build will fail.
