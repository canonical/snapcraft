# The python plugin doesn't work on trusty
systems: [-ubuntu-14*]

environment:
  SNAP_DIR: snaps/sys-path-test

restore: |
  cd "$SNAP_DIR"
  snapcraft clean
  rm -f ./*.snap

  # If the system isn't Ubuntu 16.04, we'll need to stage libc6
  if [[ "$SPREAD_SYSTEM" != ubuntu-16* ]] ; then
    echo "    stage-packages: [libc6]" >> snap/snapcraft.yaml
