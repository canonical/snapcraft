summary: Python staged from a different part
description: |
  It doesn't matter if a python interpreter is staged from
  the part using the python plugin or from a different part,
  the venv symlink should be the same (as long as the part
  using the python plugin is built after the part that
  stages the python interpreter). The expected symlink is
  python3 -> ../usr/bin/<staged interpreter>.
