## Reporting a vulnerability

<!---
Replace the first link in this section with your repository's advisories board. See
GitHub's documentation for enabling the security advisory tab on a repository:
https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository
-->

To report a security issue, file a [Private Security Report] with a description of the
issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known,
mitigations for the issue.

The [Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo policy] contains more information about
what you can expect when you contact us and what we expect from you.
