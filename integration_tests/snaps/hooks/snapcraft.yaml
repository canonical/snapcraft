  This snap simply includes a few hooks. It does so via two methods:

    1) Simply distributing hook scripts in snap/hooks.
    2) Installing hook scripts into snap/hooks from parts.

  Both of these methods should work, and the first should overwrite the second
  if the same hook is supplied via both methods (as it is here).
