#+TITLE: Configurable APT Mirrors

* Goal

Enable users to override default mirrors used by Snapcraft-created build
environments, allowing them to choose more performant / localized mirrors.

* Scope

Configuration and behavior of APT mirror configuration.

* Background

** Default primary/main mirrors configured by snapcraft:

- For i386 & amd64, Snapcraft uses: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
- For non-x86, Snapcraft uses: http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports

** Default security mirrors configured by snapcraft:

- For i386 & amd64, Snapcraft uses: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
- For non-x86, Snapcraft uses: http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports

** Currently Snapcraft supports configuring this on creation with
=SNAPCRAFT_BUILD_ENVIRONMENT_PRIMARY_MIRROR=<url>=

- This environment variable is undocumented and has no known usage.

* Implementation

Enable users to configure mirror URL with fully supported arguments:

- Modify Snapcraft to support the command-line option =--apt-mirror
  <url>= with corresponding environment variable =SNAPCRAFT_APT_MIRROR=<url>=.

- Replace =SNAPCRAFT_BUILD_ENVIRONMENT_PRIMARY_MIRROR= variable with introduced
  =SNAPCRAFT_APT_MIRROR=.
