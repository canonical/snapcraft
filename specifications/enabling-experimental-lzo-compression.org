#+TITLE: Enabling Experimental LZO compression

* Scope
There have been observations at snap runtime that some snaps might have an
improved startup time if the squash FS compression was changed.

This document defines how this *experimental* feature must work.

* Enabling the feature
As an experimental feature, an option must be used to enable this feature as
defined on [[file:20200316-enabling-experimental-features.org][Enabling Experimental Features]].

Such that the new =snapcraft.yaml= shall only be valid if called as:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
snapcraft --experimental-compression
#+END_SRC

Or with the following environment variable defined:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
SNAPCRAFT_EXPERIMENTAL_COMPRESSION=y snapcraft
#+END_SRC

* Defining compression in =snapcraft.yaml=
Snapcraft's =snapcraft.yaml= shall accept a new top-level entry =compression=
with two valid values: =lzo= and =xz= (the current default).

If this key is used without [[*Enabling the feature][Enabling the feature]] a standard schema error shall be displayed:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
Issues while validating snapcraft.yaml: Additional properties are not allowed ('compression' was unexpected)
#+END_SRC

When used with the feature enabled, the following message shall be displayed
during the /packing/ step:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
EXPERIMENTAL: Setting the squash FS compression to 'lzo'
#+END_SRC
