* Environment Management: Scope

Specification of how Snapcraft manages local and remote build
environments and their lifecycle.

This includes locally and remotely provisioned containers, VMs and build
services such as Launchpad.

* Terminology

** Snapcraft Build Environment Counter (build-count)

Counter that increments every time Snapcraft creates a new build environment.
Initialized to zero =0=.  Tracked in the environment-manager datastore.

** Snapcraft Project Path (project-path)

Absolute path to a Snapcraft project directory (containing Snapcraft.yaml,
etc.).

** Snapcraft Project Name (project-name)

Name of snap (specified in =snapcraft.yaml='s =name= field).

** Snapcraft Project (project-instance)

An instance of a Snapcraft project, found in =project-path=.

No more than one =project-instance= can exist in =project-path=.

There may be multiple =project-instance(s)= for a given =project-name=
(e.g. user working on multiple project copies simultaneously).

** Project Build Environment Instance Naming (build-instance-id)

The build environment's user-facing name.

Format: =snapcraft-<build-count>-<project-name>=

** Project Build Environment Instance (build-instance)

Project build environment instance, identified with =build-instance-id=. No more
than one =build-instance= can exist for a given =project-instance= and
=provider=.

** Environment Manager Datastore (environment-manager-datastore)

Snapcraft's persistent data storage for managing =build-instances(s)= throughout
their lifecycle.

* Build Instance Lifecycle

** Creation

Snapcraft shall re-use a previously instantiated =build-instance= for
=project-instance=, if available for the configured provider.

If no matching =build-instance= exists for the configured provider,
=snapcraft= shall create a new instance, naming it =build-instance-id=.

** Re-using Build Environments

When a =build-instance= is going to be re-used, Snapcraft shall first verify
it was created:

1. by a compatible version of Snapcraft

2. with image matching current upstream image (via hash/fingerprint)

If any of these checks fail, Snapcraft shall automatically clean the
=build-instance= and instantiate a new =build-instance= for use.

** Removal

When a =build-instance= is removed by Snapcraft, all associated metadata must
also be purged.

* User Options for Removing Build Environment Instances

Snapcraft shall provide the user with options to perform on-demand removal of
Snapcraft-created =build-instance(s)=.

** =snapcraft clean=

=snapcraft clean= shall remove all =build-instance(s)= associated with the
current =project-instance=. This extends current =snapcraft clean= behavior to
clean all known instances for all possible providers for =project-instance=.

** =snapcraft clean --all-projects=

Extends =snapcraft clean= behavior to clean all =build-instance(s)= created by
Snapcraft, for all =project-instance(s)=.

For additional safety, =--dry-run= argument shall be supported to log all
=build-instance(s)= that would be cleaned if =--dry-run= were not present.

* Environment Manager Datastore

Snapcraft shall utilize a TinyDB-based datastore with YAML storage. TinyDB
provides database functionality, including support for queries, which shall
support operations to maintain build environments throughout their lifecycle.

This =environment-manager-datastore= shall be per-user such that Snapcraft does
not require root. The =environment-manager-datastore= shall reside in
=<user-data>/snapcraft/environment-manager.yaml=, where =<user-data>= is the
first defined value of:
  1. $SNAP_USER_DATA
  2. $XDG_DATA_HOME
  3. $HOME/.local/share

** Table Schema

*** Control

The =environment-manager-datastore= shall have a =Control= table with one, and
only one, =control= record:

|--------------------------------+---------+--------------------------------------------------+---------|
