#+TITLE: Default Tracks
#+AUTHOR: Sergio Schvezov <sergio.schvezov@canonical.com>

* Scope
Allow for operations relevant to default tracks using the Snapcraft command
line.

The new commands introduced shall allow for viewing tracks and their
corresponding status as well as setting a track as a default one.

* User Experience
** Viewing Tracks
A new command shall be introduced, =snapcraft list-tracks= with an alias of
=tracks=. The command shall display the list of available tracks with potential
status values of =active=, =hidden= and =closed=. When a default track is set, the
status shall be set to =default= which will implicitly mean it is =active=.
 
The command shall be defined as:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
snapcraft track|list-tracks <snap-name>
#+END_SRC

With that criteria, this is how the output shall display for a given snap:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ snapcraft list-tracks node
  Track    Status    Creation-Date         Version-Pattern
  17       active    2020-08-26T12:13:43Z  17.*
  16       default   2020-07-26T12:13:43Z  -
  15       active    2020-07-26T12:13:43Z  -
  14       hidden    2020-06-26T12:13:43Z  -
  13       closed    2020-05-26T12:13:43Z  -
#+END_SRC

** Setting a default track
Setting a default track shall have an explicit command to do so.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ snapcraft set-default-track <snap-name> <track>
#+END_SRC

When setting a valid track, this is what the command shall output:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ snapcraft set-default-track node 17
Default track for 'node' set to '17'.
#+END_SRC

If the track is not valid, the output shall follow the convention used in
the ~SnapcraftException~ class as defined in =snapcraft.internal.errors=. With that
in mind, the following shall be displayed when an unknown track is specified:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ snapcraft set-default-track node 18
The specified track does not exist for 'node'.

Recommended resolution:
Run 'snapcraft list-tracks' to see the available tracks.

#+END_SRC

* Implementation
** Snap Store API
Snap Store APIs already exist to implement /setting/ a default track to a given
track. This is provided by the ~/metadata~ endpoint documented as part of the V1
Snap Store API [[https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/docs/api/snap.html#managing-snap-metadata][Managing Snap Metadata]].

Displaying of track information shall be resolved by the ~channel-map~ endpoint
defined in the V2 Snap Store API [[https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/docs/v2/en/snaps.html#snap-channel-map][Snap Channel Map]].

For this first implementation the default track shall be retrieved from the
=snap.default-track= field. In the future, the [[https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/docs/v2/en/snaps.html#snap-channel-map][Snap Channel Map]] endpoint shall add
a =status= field for a track list item which shall return: =active=, =hidden= and
=closed=. In this current implementation, the Snapcraft logic shall query for this
field and set a fallback value of =active= when the =status= field is not found.
The =Created= information shall be retrieved from the =creation-date= field for a track
list item from the [[*Snap Store API][Snap Store API]] endpoint.

Use of the API shall be mediated by implementation following the code style used
in =snapcraft.storeapi=.
