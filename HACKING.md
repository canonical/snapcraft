### Staging server

Snapcraft has the ability to upload snaps for publication in the Snappy Store.
If you're working on a feature that requires you to interact with the store, you
might want to use the staging server instead of the production store. To do
that, make sure you have an account on the
[staging server](https://login.staging.ubuntu.com), then run:

    source tools/staging_env.sh

You will see a prompt indicating that you are going to be talking to the staging
server. Once you are done working with the staging servers you can run `deactivate`.

### Project Layout

- **bin:** Holds the main snapcraft script. Putting this bin in your PATH or directly running scripts from it will find the rest of the source tree automatically.

- **examples:** Entering the subdirectories and running `../../bin/snapcraft snap` will generally yield interesting results. These examples will give you an idea of what snapcraft can do. These examples are not used during automated testing, they are simply for experimenting.

- **plugins:** Holds yaml metadata for the current snapcraft plugins.

- **tests:** Tests, obviously. `unit` holds Python unit tests and `plainbox` holds plainbox integration tests.

- **snapcraft:** The Python module that houses the core snapcraft logic. The `plugins` subdirectory holds the code for each plugin.

### Updating library filter

To update the list of libraries that get excluded from inclusion into a
snap run:

    ./libraries/generate_lib_list.py libraries/<release>

e.g.; to update the list for 16.04,

    ./libraries/generate_lib_list.py libraries/16.04

### Installing using pip

If you don't have python3 installed, you can use the one from the archives:

    sudo apt install python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-pkg-resources

Install the needed dependencies.

    sudo apt install build-essential python3-dev libapt-pkg-dev libsodium-dev gcc libffi-dev libarchive13 squashfs-tools xdelta

If installing to `PYTHONHOME` run:

    pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt -r requirements-devel.txt

If your prefer installing in a virtualenv, then in an activated environment run:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-devel.txt

### Testing

We assume you have run through the installation instructions, to run all the tests execute:

    ./runtests.sh

You can selectively run a selective group of tests like:

    ./runtests.sh [static|unit|integration|snaps]
