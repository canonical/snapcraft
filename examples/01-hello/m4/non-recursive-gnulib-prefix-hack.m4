  AC_CONFIG_LIBOBJ_DIR([lib])

  # This hack originated in bison.  It is required when using non-recursive
  # automake rules to build from gnulib-provided lib/ sources.  Hence, LIB_DIR
  # is usually simply "lib".  Those rules use the list of names like "fchdir.o"
  # and "strstr.o" in gl_LIBOBJS.  With non-recursive make, we must prefix each
  # such file name with the "lib/" prefix.  See also build-aux/prefix-gnulib-mk.
  gl_LIBOBJS=`echo "$gl_LIBOBJS" | sed -e 's, , $1/,g'`

  # Listing the names of the variables to prefix is error-prone.
  # Rather, adjust each AC_SUBST'd variable whose name ends in '_H'
  # and whose value ends in '.h'.
