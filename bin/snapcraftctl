# This file exists because snapcraftctl must be run using a clean environment
# that is uninfluenced by the environment of the part using it. There are a few
# reasons for this:
#
#   1. snapcraftctl is a python3 utility, but Snapcraft supports building python2
#      parts, where PYTHONPATH et. al. are set for python2.
#   2. snapcraftctl is part of snapcraft, which loads up various libraries that
#      can be influenced with LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which is set for many parts.
#
# Not only this, but the only way snapcraftctl works reliably is if it's run
# by exactly the same interpreter as snapcraft itself (otherwise it won't find
# snapcraft). To that end, this script will use the interpreter defined within
# the SNAPCRAFT_INTERPRETER environment variable.

# Shell quote arbitrary string by replacing every occurrence of '
# with '\'', then put ' at the beginning and end of the string.
# Prepare yourself, fun regex ahead.
