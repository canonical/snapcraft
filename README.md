# Snapcraft

Snapcraft is a delightful packaging tool

Snapcraft helps you assemble a whole project in a single tree out of
many pieces. It can drive a very wide range of build and packaging systems,
so that you can simply list all the upstream projects you want and have
them built and installed together as a single tree.

For example, say you want to make a product that includes PyPI packages,
Node.js packages from NPM, Java, and a bunch of daemons written in C and
C++ that are built with autotools, snapcraft would make assembling the
final tree very easy.

Snapcraft allows easy crafting of snap packages for the Ubuntu Core
transactional system.

See the [intro](https://github.com/ubuntu-core/snapcraft/blob/master/docs/intro.md)
for details about the concepts behind
snapcraft. There is also a [tutorial](https://github.com/ubuntu-core/snapcraft/blob/master/docs/intro.md). If you're interested in developing Snapcraft you should look at the [hacking guide](https://github.com/ubuntu-core/snapcraft/blob/master/HACKING.md).
