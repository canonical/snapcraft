# Snapcraft

Package, distribute, and update any app for Linux and IoT.

Snaps are containerised software packages that are simple to create and 
install. They auto-update and are safe to run. And because they bundle their
dependencies, they work on all major Linux systems without modification.

[Build your first snap](https://docs.snapcraft.io/build-snaps/languages) or learn more about how [Snapcraft can help you](https://snapcraft.io).
