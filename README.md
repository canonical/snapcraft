# Snapcraft

Snapcraft is a delightful packaging tool

Snapcraft helps you assemble a whole project in a single tree out of
many pieces. It can drive a very wide range of build and packaging systems,
so that you can simply list all the upstream projects you want and have
them built and installed together as a single tree.

For example, say you want to make a product that includes PyPI packages,
Node.js packages from NPM, Java, and a bunch of daemons written in C and
C++ that are built with autotools, snapcraft would make assembling the
final tree very easy.

Snapcraft allows easy crafting of snap packages for the [snappy Ubuntu Core](http://ubuntu.com/snappy)
transactional update system.
