# Welcome to the Snapcraft Tour!

Each directory and subdirectory has a README that introduces new concepts.
All the relevant example code is also in those directories, so you have
everything you need.

It's about a morning's work to get through the tour, by the end of it you
can easily make a snap of a well-behaved application for which you have
source code.
