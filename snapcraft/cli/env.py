    To determine the build environment, SNAPCRAFT_BUILD_ENVIRONMENT is
    retrieved from the environment and used to determine the build
    provider. If it is not set, a value of `host` is assumed.

    Valid values are:

    - host: the host will drive the build.
    - lxd: the host will setup a container to drive the build.
    - multipass: a vm driven by multipass will be created to drive the build.

    Use of the lxd value is equivalent to setting the now deprecated
    SNAPCRAFT_CONTAINER_BUILDS environment variable to a value that
    would evaluate to True.
    Setting this variable to a value that resolves to a non boolean
    results in an error.
