"""Snapcraft plugins drive different build systems

Each part has a build system . Most parts are built from source using one of
a range of build systems such as CMake or Scons. Some parts are pre-built
and just copied into place, for example parts that reuse existing binary
packages.

You tell snapcraft which build system it must drive by specifying the
snapcraft plugin for that part. Every part must specify a plugin explicitly
(when you see a part that does not specify a plugin, thats because the
actual part definition is in the cloud, where the plugin is specified!)

These plugins implement a lifecycle over the following steps:

  - pull:   retrieve the source for the part from the specified location
  - build:  drive the build system determined by the choice of plugin
  - stage:  consolidate desireable files from all the parts in one tree
  - prime:  distill down to only the files which will go into the snap
  - snap:   compress the prime tree into the installable snap file

These steps correspond to snapcraft commands. So when you initiate a
'snapcraft pull' you will invoke the respective plugin for each part in
the snap, in sequence, to handle the source pull. Each part will then have a
fully populated parts/<part-name>/src/ directory. Similarly, if you then say
'snapcraft build' you will invoke the plugin responsible for each part in
turn, to build the part.

# Snapcraft Lifecycle

## Pull

In this first step, source material is retrieved from the specified
location, whether that is a URL for a tarball, a local path to a source tree
inside the snap, a revision control reference to checkout, or something
specific to the plugin such as PyPI. The plugin might also download
necessary artifacts, such as the Java SDK, which are not specific to the
particular part but which are needed by the plugin to handle its type of
build system.

All the downloaded content for each part goes into the
`parts/<part-name>/src/` directory, which acts as a cache to prevent
re-fetching content. You can clean that cache out with 'snapcraft clean'.

## Build

Snapcraft calculates an appropriate sequence to build the parts, based on
explicit 'after' references and the order of the parts in the
snapcraft.yaml. Each part is built in the `parts/<part-name>/build`
directory and installed into `parts/<part-name>/install`.

Note the install step - we might actually want to use built artifacts from
one part in the build process of another, so the `parts/<part-name>/install`
directory is useful as a 'working fresh install' of the part.

Between the plugin, the part definition YAML, and the build system of the
part, it is expected that the part can be built and installed in the right
place.

At this point you have a tree under `parts/` with a subdirectory for every
part, and underneath those, separate src, build and install trees for each
part.

## Stage

We now need to start consolidating the important pieces of each part into a
single tree. We do this twice - once in a very sweeping way that will
produce a lot of extraneous materials but is useful for debugging. This is
the 'stage' step of the lifecycle, because we move a lot of the build output
from each part into a consolidated tree under `stage/` which has the
structure of a snap but has way too much extra information.

The important thing about the staging area is that it lets you get all the
shared libraries in one place and lets you find overlapping content in the
parts. You can also try this directory as if it were a snap, and you'll have
all the debugging information in the tree, which is useful for developers.

Each part describes its own staging content - the files that should be
staged. The part will often describe "chunks" of content, called filesets,
so that they can be referred to as a useful set rather than having to call
out individual files.

## Prime

It is useful to have a directory tree which exactly mirrors the structure of
the final snap. This is the `prime/` directory, and the lifecycle includes a
'prime' step which copies only that final, required content from the
`stage/` directory into the `prime/` directory.

So the `prime/` directory contains only the content that will be put into
the final snap, unlike the staging area which may include debug and
development files not destined for your snap.

The snap metadata will also be placed in `./prime/meta` during the prime
step, so this `./prime` directory is useful for inspecting exactly what is
going into your snap or to conduct any final post-processing on snapcraft's
output.

## Snap

The final step in the snapcraft lifecycle builds a snap out of the `prime/`
directory. It will be in the top level directory, alongside snapcraft.yaml,
called <name>-<version>-<arch>.snap


# Standard part definition keywords

There are several builtin keywords which can be used in any part regardless
of the choice of plugin.

  - after: [part, part, part...]

    Snapcraft will make sure that it builds all of the listed parts before
    it tries to build this part. Essentially these listed dependencies for
    this part, useful when the part needs a library or tool built by another
    part.

    If such a dependency part is not defined in this snapcraft.yaml, it must
    be defined in the cloud parts library, and snapcraft will retrieve the
    definition of the part from the cloud. In this way, a shared library of
    parts is available to every snap author - just say 'after' and list the
    parts you want that others have already defined.

  - build-packages: [deb, deb, deb...]

    A list of Ubuntu packages to install on the build host before building
    the part. The files from these packages will not go into the final snap
    unless they are also explicitly described in stage-packages.

  - stage-packages: [deb, deb, deb...]

    A list of Ubuntu packages must be unpacked in the `stage/` directory.
    XXX before build? Before stage?

  - organize: YAML

    Snapcraft will rename files according to this YAML sub-section. The
    content of the 'organize' section consists of old path keys, and their
    new values after the renaming.

    This can be used to avoid conflicts between parts that use the same
    name, or to map content from different parts into a common conventional
    file structure. For example:

      organize:
        usr/oldfilename: usr/newfilename
        usr/local/share/: usr/share/

    The key is the internal part filename, the value is the exposed filename
    that will be used during the staging process. You can rename whole
    subtrees of the part, or just specific files.

    Note that the path is relative (even though it is "usr/local") because
    it refers to content underneath parts/<part-name>/install which is going
    to be mapped into the stage and prime areas.

  - filesets: YAML

    When we map files into the stage and prime areas on the way to putting
    them into the snap, it is convenient to be able to refer to groups of
    files as well as individual files.  Snapcraft lets you name a fileset
    and then use it later for inclusion or exclusion of those files from the
    resulting snap.

    For example, consider man pages of header files.. You might want them
    in, or you might want to leave them out, but you definitely don't want
    to repeatedly have to list all of them either way.

    This section is thus a YAML map of fileset names (the keys) to a list of
    filenames. The list is built up by adding individual files or whole
    subdirectory paths (and all the files under that path) and wildcard
    globs, and then pruning from those paths.

    The wildcard * globs all files in that path. Exclusions are denoted by
    an initial `-`.

    For example you could add usr/local/* then remove usr/local/man/*:

      filesets:
        allbutman: [ usr/local/*, -usr/local/man/* ]
        manpages: [ usr/local/man ]

    Filenames are relative to the part install directory in
    `parts/<part-name>/install`. If you have used 'organize' to rename files
    then the filesets will be built up from the names after organization.

  - stage: YAML file and fileset list

    A list of files from a part install directory to copy into `stage/`.
    Rules applying to the list here are the same as those of filesets.
    Referencing of fileset keys is done with a $ prefixing the fileset key,
    which will expand with the value of such key.

    For example:

      stage:
        - usr/lib/*   # Everything under parts/<part-name>/install/usr/lib
        - -usr/lib/libtest.so   # Excludng libtest.so
        - $manpages             # Including the 'manpages' fileset

  - prime: YAML file and fileset list

    A list of files from a part install directory to copy into `prime/`.
    This section takes exactly the same form as the 'stage' section  but the
    files identified here will go into the ultimate snap (because the
    `prime/` directory reflects the file structure of the snap with no
    extraneous content).
