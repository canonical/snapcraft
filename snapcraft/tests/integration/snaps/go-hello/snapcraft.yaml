summary: A simple go project.
description: |
  This is a basic go snap.
  It just prints a hello world and checksthat it is possible to build a snap
  using local go sources.
  The name of the binary will be that of the directory containing it,
  just like it is seen when using `go build` or `go install`.
  If you want to add other functionalities to this snap, please don't.
  Make a new one.
