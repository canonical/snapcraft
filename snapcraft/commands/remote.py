        Command remote-build sends the current project to be built
        remotely.  After the build is complete, packages for each
        architecture are retrieved and will be available in the
        local filesystem.

        If the project contains a ``platforms`` or ``architectures`` key,
        then the project's build plan is used. The build plan can be filtered
        using the ``--build-for`` argument.

        If the project doesn't contain a ``platforms`` or ``architectures`` key,
        then the architectures to build for are defined by the ``--build-for``
        argument.

        If there are no architectures defined in the project file or with
        ``--build-for``, then the default behavior is to build for the host
        architecture of the local machine.

        Interrupted remote builds can be resumed using the --recover
        option.

        To set a timeout on the remote-build command, use the option
        ``--launchpad-timeout=<seconds>``. The timeout is local, so the build on
        launchpad will continue even if the local instance of snapcraft is
        interrupted or times out.
