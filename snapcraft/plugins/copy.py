"""The copy plugin is useful for assets or other sources with no build system.

This plugin is DEPRECATED in favor of the `dump` plugin.

This plugin uses the common plugin keywords as well as those for 'sources'
(though the 'source' keyword is optional). For more information check the
'plugins' topic for the former and the 'sources' topic for the latter.

Additionally, this plugin uses the following plugin-specific keywords:

    - files:
      (object)
      A dictionary of key-value pairs. The key is the current location of the
      file relative to snapcraft.yaml (unless `source` is specified, in which
      case it's relative to the root of the source). The value is where to
      place the file in-snap, and is relative to the root of the snap. This
      works like `cp -r <key> <value>`. Note that globbing is supported for the
      key, allowing one to use *, ?, and character ranges expressed with [].
