""" Create parts containing a Plainbox test collection known as a provider.

Plainbox is a toolkit consisting of python3 library, development tools,
documentation and examples. It is targeted at developers working on testing or
certification applications and authors creating tests for such applications.
More information: http://plainbox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

To find out more about authoring a plainbox provider, see the following
documentation: http://plainbox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/author/providers.html

This plugin uses the common plugin keywords as well as those for "sources".
For more information check the 'plugins' topic for the former and the
'sources' topic for the latter.
