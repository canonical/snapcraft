"""This flutter plugin is useful for building flutter based parts.

This plugin uses the common plugin keywords as well as those for "sources".
For more information check the 'plugins' topic for the former and the
'sources' topic for the latter.

Additionally, this plugin uses the following plugin-specific keywords:

    - flutter-revision
      (string)
      Which Flutter revision to use for the build. This must be a valid
      revision from the flutter repository.
    - flutter-target
      (string, default: lib/main.dart)
      The main entry-point file of the application

This plugin works best with the flutter related extensions.
