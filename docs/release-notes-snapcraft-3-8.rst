Release notes: Snapcraft 3.8
============================

These are the release notes for `Snapcraft 3.8 <https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/releases/tag/3.8>`__.

For general details, including installation instructions, see :ref:`Snapcraft overview <snapcraft-overview>`, or take a look at :ref:`Snapcraft release notes <snapcraft-release-notes>` for other *Snapcraft* releases.

New *core* features
-------------------

Windows installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A lot of work has been done in preparation for the imminent installer for Microsoft Windows, which means Snapcraft will soon be able to run natively on Windows.

Improved build-base support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following snap types have been added to :ref:`build-base <base-snaps-base-snap>`:

-  kernel
-  snapd

Extensions
----------

Extensions replace :ref:`Remote parts <remote-reusable-parts>` to help developers easily incorporate a group of components with single package.

They’re used at build and run time to ensure the inclusion of any necessary build and run dependencies.

Gnome 3.28
~~~~~~~~~~

This release includes an extension to support Gnome 3.28. For discovery, run:

.. code:: bash

   $ snapcraft list-extensions

Use the ``extension`` command to read details on what an extension does:

.. code:: bash

   $ snapcraft extension gnome-3-28

The Gnome extension configures each application with the following plugs:

-  GTK3 themes
-  common icon themes
-  common sound themes
-  Gnome 3.28 runtime libraries and utilities.

For easier desktop integration, it also configures each application entry with these additional plugs:

-  :ref:`desktop <the-desktop-interface>`
-  :ref:`desktop-legacy <the-desktop-legacy-interface>`
-  :ref:`wayland <the-wayland-interface>`
-  :ref:`x11 <the-x11-interface>`

To add the Gnome extension to an existing ``snapcraft.yaml``, add ``gnome-3-28`` to the ``apps`` entry that requires it.

To see how it *extends* the ``snapcraft.yaml``, at the root of the project, run

.. code:: bash

   $ snapcraft expand-extensions

Plugins
-------

:ref:`colcon <the-colcon-plugin>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We’ve added a new syntax to ignore packages:

.. code:: yaml

   - colcon-packages-ignore:
     (list of strings)
     List of colcon packages to ignore. If not specified or set to an empty
     list ([]), no packages will be ignored.

There’s also a fix to enforce parallel building hints from snapcraft.

:ref:`catkin <the-catkin-plugin>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alongside colcon (above), the catkin plugin also includes a fix to enforce parallel building hints from snapcraft.

:ref:`rust <the-rust-plugin>`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for properly building on s390x (natively) has been added.
