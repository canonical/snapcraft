# Getting set up

Ubuntu is an excellent OS for developers. The Snappy developer tools are
readily available in Ubuntu, so porting and writing new software to target a
Snap-based system is particularly easy.

For app developers that want the latest stable tools to work on Snappy
technology, we recommend using the latest classic Ubuntu Long-Term Support
(LTS) release as the host. At the time of writing this is Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. For
those not using an Ubuntu machine, you can use a virtual machine (e.g.
VirtualBox, VMware, Vagrant, etc.) to run your Ubuntu development environment.

**Note:** If you're targeting Snappy 15.04, you should be using
[Snapcraft 1][1], which is only supported on releases prior to 16.04.

Once your Ubuntu system is up and running, simply install Snapcraft:

    $ sudo apt install snapcraft
