Enable experimental extensions
==============================

Some extensions aren't as refined or well-tested, and are flagged as experimental. They
aren't available by default.

If you're comfortable with using experimental extensions and understand the risks, you
can use them by exporting the following environment variable before running Snapcraft:

.. code-block:: bash

    SNAPCRAFT_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_EXTENSIONS=1
