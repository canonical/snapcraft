Example Qt5 KDE app
===================

This how-to guide covers the steps, decisions, and implementation details that
are unique when crafting a snap for an app that uses Qt5 KDE. We'll work
through the aspects unique to Qt5 KDE apps by examining an existing project.


Example project file for KCalc
------------------------------

The following code comprises the project file of a Qt5 KDE app, `KCalc
<https://github.com/KDE/kcalc>`_. This project is the calculator of KDE Gear.

.. collapse:: KCalc project file

    .. literalinclude:: ../code/craft-a-snap/example-qt5-kde-recipe.yaml
        :caption: snapcraft.yaml
        :language: yaml
        :lines: 2-


Add an app that uses KDE
------------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../code/craft-a-snap/example-qt5-kde-recipe.yaml
    :caption: snapcraft.yaml
    :language: yaml
    :start-at: apps:
    :end-at: - pulseaudio

Apps that use KDE runtime libraries require the `kde-neon
<https://snapcraft.io/docs/kde-neon-extension>`_. The extension configures the
runtime environment of the app so that all desktop functionality is correctly
initialised. As desktop environment apps, they also need special configuration
for AppStream and ``.desktop`` file compatibility.

To add a GTK4 app:

#. Declare the general app keys, such as ``command``,
   ``plugs``, ``after``, and so on.
#. For ``extensions``, add ``kde-neon``.
#. Set ``common-id`` to the app's unique AppStream ID. Doing so links the app
   to the ``.desktop`` launcher specified in the AppStream file.


Add a part written for Qt5 KDE
------------------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../code/craft-a-snap/example-qt5-kde-recipe.yaml
    :caption: snapcraft.yaml
    :language: yaml
    :start-at: parts:
    :end-at: - "-DKDE_SKIP_TEST_SETTINGS=ON"

Qt5 KDE parts don't require a special plugin. Instead, they need extra snap dependencies.

To add a Qt5 KDE part:

#. Declare the general part keys, such as ``plugin``, ``source``,
   ``build-packages``, and so on.
#. So that the app has access to its AppStream metadata, for ``parse-info`` add
   a path to the AppStream ``.xml`` file on the host system. Since we set
   ``adopt-info: kcalc`` at the start of the project file, the AppStream file of the
   ``kcalc`` part will be used to fill in the ``summary``, ``description`` and
   ``icon`` of this snap and copy the AppStream file. See `Using AppStream
   metadata
   <https://snapcraft.io/docs/using-external-metadata#heading--appstream>`_ for
   technical details about how this works.
#. For ``build-snaps``, list the following dependencies:

   .. literalinclude:: ../code/craft-a-snap/example-qt5-kde-recipe.yaml
       :caption: snapcraft.yaml
       :language: yaml
       :dedent: 6
       :lines: 37-38
