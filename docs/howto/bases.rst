Bases

How to use a base
-----------------

The base a snap will use is defined in the snap's `snapcraft.yaml`_.

To use the ``core24`` base for a snap:

.. code-block:: yaml

   base: core24


How to migrate to a newer base
------------------------------

See `migrating bases`_ for details on migrating to a newer base.


How to use a deprecated base
----------------------------

The latest release of Snapcraft does not support older bases. Prior major
Snapcraft releases are supported and can be installed from Snapcraft's
`tracks`_.

See :ref:`base snaps<base-snap-reference>` for a list of which Snapcraft
major releases support a particular base.

See `Snapcraft and ESM`_ for details on support for deprecated bases.

``core18``
^^^^^^^^^^

To build ``core18`` snaps, install snapcraft 7 from the *7.x* track:

.. code-block:: shell

   snap install snapcraft --channel 7.x

``core``
^^^^^^^^

To build ``core`` snaps, install snapcraft 4 from the *4.x* track:

.. code-block:: shell

   snap install snapcraft --channel 4.x


The base snap mounts itself as the root filesystem within your snap such that
when your application runs, the baseâ€™s library paths are searched directly
after the paths for your specific snap.

How to develop supported and deprecated bases
---------------------------------------------

When developing snaps using supported and deprecated bases at the same time,
developers must use different versions of Snapcraft. There are a few options:

Refresh channels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Switch between Snapcraft releases by refreshing channels. ``snapd`` retains the
previously installed snap, so refreshing between two channels should not
require re-downloading Snapcraft.

.. code-block:: shell

   snap refresh snapcraft --channel 7.x
   snap refresh snapcraft --channel 8.x

Parallel installs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multiple instances of Snapcraft can be installed via ``snapd``'s experimental
parallel install feature. See the `Parallel installs`_ documentation for
details.

.. code-block:: shell

   snap install snapcraft snapcraft_7 --channel 7.x
   snap install snapcraft snapcraft_8 --channel 8.x
   snapcraft_8 pack

Containers
^^^^^^^^^^

Isolated development environments allow using different versions of Snapcraft
simultaneously.

`Snapcraft rocks`_ are the recommended way to build snaps in a container.


How to bootstrap a base snap
----------------------------

The ``build-base`` keyword is used to bootstrap and create new bases.

To bootstrap the ``core26`` base snap, use the following ``snapcraft.yaml``
snippet:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: core26
   type: base
   build-base: core24

This snippet will do the following:

* ``name: core26`` sets the snap's name to ``core26``.
* ``type: base`` creates a base snap.
* ``build-base: core24`` builds the snap inside an Ubuntu 24.04 build
  environment.
* ``base`` cannot be set in the ``snapcraft.yaml`` file


.. _kernel-snap-how-to:

How to build a kernel snap
--------------------------

The ``build-base`` keyword is used to build kernel snaps for Ubuntu LTS
releases.

To build a kernel snap targeting the Ubuntu 22.04 release, use the following
``snapcraft.yaml`` snippet:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: pc-kernel
   type: kernel
   build-base: core22

This snippet will do the following:

* create a kernel snap for Ubuntu 22.04
* build the snap inside an Ubuntu 22.04 build environment
* use the ``core22`` feature set and ``snapcraft.yaml`` schema

How to build a bare base snap
-----------------------------

Bare base snaps are useful for fully statically linked applications and will
not have access to a base snap at runtime.

To build a bare base snap, use the following ``snapcraft.yaml`` snippet:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: my-snap
   base: bare
   build-base: core24

This snippet will build a bare base snap inside an Ubuntu 24.04 build
environment.
