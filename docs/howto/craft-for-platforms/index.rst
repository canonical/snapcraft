Craft for platforms
===================

Apps are often built using programming languages and technologies that
are supplied with their own build tools. Snapcraft uses plugins to integrate
with these tools in order to create snaps.

Snapcraft can package apps and programs from many programming languages,
frameworks, and meta build systems, which for simplicity we call *platforms*
(no relation to the term as it's used in snap recipes).

You can create snaps from apps you've already built and zipped, or directly from source.

All supported platforms receive the same benefits from having their apps
snapped.

Choose a from the following guides to see examples for each platform, and
review the unique elements of crafting a snap for them.
