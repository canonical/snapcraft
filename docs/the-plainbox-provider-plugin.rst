The plainbox-provider plugin
============================

The ``plainbox-provider`` plugin can be used to create parts containing a `PlainBox <https://launchpad.net/plainbox>`__ test collection, known as a *provider*.

   ⓘ This plugin is only available to *core* and *core18* based snaps. See :ref:`Base snaps <base-snaps>` for details.

PlainBox is a toolkit consisting of a Python 3 library, development tools, documentation and examples. It is targeted at developers working on testing or certification applications, alongside authors creating tests for such applications.

For further details, see the `PlainBox Documentation <https://git.launchpad.net/plainbox/tree/docs>`__. To find out more about authoring a PlainBox provider, refer to `Providers <https://git.launchpad.net/plainbox/plain/docs/author/providers.rst>`__.

This plugin uses the common plugin keywords as well as those for “sources”. For more information, see :ref:`Snapcraft parts metadata <snapcraft-parts-metadata>`.
