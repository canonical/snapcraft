The steam-support interface
===========================

The ``steam-support`` interface has been developed specifically to help Valveâ€™s Steam client configure `pressure-vessel <https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/steam-runtime-tools/-/tree/master/pressure-vessel>`__ containers from the `Steam snap <https://snapcraft.io/steam>`__.

Only the Steam snap may establish this interface. See `Introducing early access to the Steam snap <https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/introducing-early-access-to-the-steam-snap/28082>`__ for more details.

.. note::


          See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
