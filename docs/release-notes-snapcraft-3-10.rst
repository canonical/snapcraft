Release notes: Snapcraft 3.10
=============================

These are the release notes for `Snapcraft 3.10 <https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/releases/tag/3.10>`__.

For general details, including installation instructions, see :ref:`Snapcraft overview <snapcraft-overview>`, or take a look at :ref:`Snapcraft release notes <snapcraft-release-notes>` for other *Snapcraft* releases.

New *core* features
-------------------

Configurable system usernames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Snapcraft now supports the configuration of :ref:`system usernames <system-usernames>` for daemons. This functionality was recently added to snapd, and enables a daemon to run as the user specified within an application’s ‘command’ entry, for example, among other functions.

Primed stage packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Snapcraft now tracks the files within a snap that are derived from those listed under ``staged-packages``.

A build manifest already includes the set of all staged packages in ``staged-packages``, but the build manifest also includes files that were installed, then removed or filtered out, from the resulting snap.

The resulting list of staged and tracked packages is maintained within ``primed-stage-packages``. Security notices will eventually use ``primed-stage-packages`` to reduce the number of false positive alerts that are caused by staged-packages listing packages that are not eventually present in the snap.

CLI improvements
----------------

New CLI configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Snapcraft now reads a configuration file to populate the default *snapcraft* command-line options.

-  Location: ``$HOME/.config/snapcraft/config.yaml``
-  Syntax: ``YAML``
-  Valid configuration options: Anything that matches a snapcraft CLI command option (e.g. provider, bind-ssh, debug, http-proxy, https-proxy) for arguments. The configuration file uses YAML syntax and supports any option that matches a valid snapcraft argument.

For example, a config like:

.. code:: yaml

   use-lxd: true
   bind-ssh: true
   http-proxy: http://192.168.1.10:3128
   https-proxy: http://192.168.1.10:3128 `

Matches:

.. code:: bash

   snapcraft --use-lxd \
             --bind-ssh \
             --http-proxy http://10.155.149.232:3128 \
             --https-proxy http://10.155.149.232:3128

..

   ℹ While an argument can be overridden, it cannot be unset. For instance, if using http-proxy`` or ``debug``, there is no method to currently unset these values.

Remote Build
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many improvements have been made to :ref:`Remote build <remote-build>`, including the removal of unnecessary options such as entering a Launchpad ID, which is provided via the login process.

To build snaps, ``remote build`` previously used snapcraft from the ``edge``\ channel. From this release, snaps are created using snapcraft from the ``stable`` channel.

The user interface has also been cleaned-up, with more changes on the way.

Build providers
---------------

HTTP proxies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Snapcraft now supports passing ``http_proxy`` and ``https_proxy`` through to LXD and Multipass build environments. Options have also been added to specify these using ``--http-proxy <proxy>`` and ``-https-proxy <proxy>``.

Bind SSH
~~~~~~~~

Local SSH configuration can now be passed through to LXD and Multipass environments.

The user’s SSH directory, (eg. ``${HOME}/.ssh``), is bind-mounted to the build-environment, enabling SSH configuration within that build environment. This option is enabled by using ``--bind-ssh`` with the LXD or Multipass providers.

Plugins
-------

Rust
~~~~

The Rust plugin now correctly works with `cargo workspaces <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html>`__.

From this release, the default is to now use the minimal rust profile for building, which solves a problem of generally building on s390x, arm64 and Ppcel64 architectures.

A few smaller issues, such as using the same path for ``CARGO_HOME`` and ``RUSTUP_HOME``, have been fixes with this release, and ``Cargo.lock`` files are now also properly respected.

Go
~~

The Go plugin has been cleaned-up and, as part of this release, now includes support for `Go Mod <https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules>`__

If a project makes use of the Go Modules feature, the **right** things will happen.

Catkin
~~~~~~

A long lived workaround has been removed from the robotics tooling. This includes the ‘rospack’ workaround now that ``rosdep -i`` works correctly.

Another improvement to the plugin includes fixing an issue when using ’–destructive-mode`, where some installation paths from the host machine leaked into the list of paths,considered by the Catkin plugin. This resulted in dependencies being found in the host path and consequently not being installed by the plugin in the expected **parts** path.

Python
~~~~~~

From this release, the Python plugin will process its requirements separately from ``setup.py. This helps to better satisfying local dependencies declared in``\ install_requires`. As a result, building becomes less costly as wheels are not unnecessarily generated with every build.

The Python plugin also creates a cleaner ``sitecustomize`` that no longer leaks Snapcraft’s ``site-packages`` into the part that the plugin processes.

Extensions
----------

Projects using extensions will gain better performance with this release, thanks to the scaffolding to bring up desktop applications being improved. These improvements include pre-checks being run before spawning shells to run some setup commands (even if they were idempotent - pre-checking avoids their cost).

Icon caching pre-checks are now also in place, and can reduce the time to bring up an application by up to 10 seconds.

Information Parsing
-------------------

AppStream
~~~~~~~~~

Several AppStream fixes arrive with this release. These include a fix related to silently breaking XSLT transformations, when comments were present in the AppStream file, and support for the recently specced ``<em>`` and ``<code>`` tags. These are now supported by Snapcraft when using the ``parse-info`` functionality with AppStream files.
