Gadget snaps
============

The gadget snap is responsible for defining and configuring system properties specific to one or more devices.

The gadget metadata and content defines:

- The layout of the volumes that comprise the device storage and image
- Configuration for the bootloader to use. The gadget also ships the bootloader itself and other boot assets.
- Default configuration options to use when snaps are installed.
- Interface connections configured in the ``connections:`` section are executed on the device’s first boot only. Later changes to this section – that is, changes added to the device at run time through gadget refreshes – are not applied.
- Optional hooks that are invoked to control and customise the behaviour over the device lifecycle, e.g. installation, initialisation and establishing device identity, factory reset.

See `Building a gadget snap <https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/gadget-building>`__ for details on how a gadget snap can be built. For store deployment, gadget snaps must be produced by the device :ref:`brand <glossary>`, as defined in the `model assertion <https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/reference/assertions/model>`__, or a reference gadget must be used. It is perfectly possible for different models to share a gadget snap.

--------------

A typical gadget snap will consist of the following:

- `Setup files <gadget-snaps-setup_>`__
- `Gadget.yaml <gadget-snaps-gadget_>`__
- `Volumes <gadget-snaps-volumes_>`__
- `Specification <gadget-snaps-specification_>`__
- `Raspberry Pi example <gadget-snaps-piexample_>`__
- `Prepare-device hook <gadget-snaps-prepare_>`__ - `Example script <gadget-snaps-example-prepare_>`__


.. _gadget-snaps-setup:

Setup files
-----------

In addition to traditional snap metadata, the gadget snap also holds some setup files fundamental to the initialisation and lifecycle of the device:

-  **meta/snap.yaml**: traditional snap details, with ``type: gadget`` explicitly defined.
-  **meta/gadget.yaml**: gadget-specific information. See below.
-  **grub.conf**: required grub configuration when using this bootloader.
-  **u-boot.conf**: required U-Boot configuration when using this bootloader.
-  **cloud.conf**: optional `cloud-init <https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ configuration; cloud-init is disabled if missing.

Sample configuration files may be found in the current reference gadget snaps:

- `Raspberry Pi (2B, 3B, 3A+, 3B+, 4B, Compute Module 3, and Compute Module 3+) <https://github.com/snapcore/pi-gadget>`__
- `amd64 <https://github.com/snapcore/pc-amd64-gadget>`__ - `i386 <https://github.com/snapcore/pc-i386-gadget>`__

In the near future, we expect to add a RISC-V reference gadget snap to this list.


.. _gadget-snaps-gadget:

The gadget.yaml file
--------------------

Two YAML keys are used to describe your target device:

-  **defaults** (YAML sub-section, optional): default configuration options for the defined snaps, applied on installation: ``yaml  defaults:        <snap id>:            <key>: <value>`` In addition to ``<snap id>``, it is also possible to use ``system`` to define system-wide configuration options, similar to running ``snap set system key=value``: ``yaml  defaults:        system:            <key>: <value>``

.. note::
          Defaults only become available during snap installation.

          Values in ``defaults:`` (other than ``system:``) are not consumed and do not become available until either the :ref:`configure hook <supported-snap-hooks-the-configure-hook>` or the :ref:`default-configure hook <supported-snap-hooks-default-configure>` are run as part of the corresponding snap installation. ``system:`` values are set immediately.



-  **volumes** (YAML sub-section, required): the volumes layout, where each disk image is represented as a YAML sub-section.


.. _gadget-snaps-volumes:

The volumes mapping sub-section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each volume entry is described by:

- a name as defined by the entry key
- a partition structure (required)
- a bootloader definition (``grub``, ``u-boot``)
- a partitioning schema eg. ``mbr``. Defaults to ``gpt`` if unspecified.

Volumes define the structure and content of the images to be written into one or more block devices of the gadget device. Each volume in the mapping represents a different image for a “disk” in the device.

Ubuntu Core 20 typically uses the following storage partitions:

-  **ubuntu-seed** (role: system-seed; *read-only, ext4 or typically vfat*)
-  **ubuntu-boot** (role: system-boot; *read-only, ext4* or *vfat*):
-  **ubuntu-save** (role: system-save; *writable, ext4*, **encrypted**)
-  **ubuntu-data** (role: system-data; *writable*, ext4, **encrypted**)

**ubuntu-save** is mandatory on an encrypted system. The *initramfs* bootstrapped from **ubuntu-boot** is responsible for decrypting both the **ubuntu-save** and **ubuntu-data** partitions.

**ubuntu-data** needs to be the last partition. No extra partitions can be inserted between **ubuntu-boot**, **ubuntu-save** and **ubuntu-data**. If extra partitions are required, they need to be declared and created before **ubuntu-boot**.

The structure section lists entities with gadget data inside the image, most of which are partitions with a file system inside, with the exception of structures of type: bare, which can describe a region of data without a corresponding entry in the partition table.


.. _gadget-snaps-specification:

Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``meta/gadget.yaml`` file contains the basic metadata for gadget-specific functionality, including a detailed specification of which structure items compose an image. The latter is used both by snapd and by ubuntu-image when creating images for these devices.

A gadget snap’s boot assets can also be automatically updated when the snap is refreshed. See :ref:`Updating gadget boot assets <updating-gadget-boot-assets>` for further details.

The following specification defines what is supported in ``gadget.yaml``:

.. code:: yaml

   # Define the format of this file. The default and latest format is zero.
   # Clients reading this file must reject it the format is greater than
   # the supported one. (optional)
   format: <int>

   # Default configuration options for defined snaps, applied on installation.
   # The snap ID may be discovered via the snap info command.
   # Since 2.33 snap ID can be the "system" nick to cover the system
   # configuration. (optional)
   defaults:
       <snap id>:
           <key>: <value>

   # Interface connection instructions for plugs and slots of seeded
   # snaps to connect at first boot. snap IDs can be the "system"
   # nick as well. Omitting "slot" in an instruction is allowed
   # and equivalent then to: slot: system:<plug>
   # (since 2.34) (optional)
   connections:
      -  plug: <plug snap id>:<plug>
         slot: <slot snap id>:<slot>

   # Volumes defining the structure and content for the images to be written
   # into one or more block devices of the gadget device. Each volume in
   # in the structure represents a different image for a "disk" in the device.
   # (optional)
   volumes:

     # Name of volume and output image file. Must match [a-z-]+. (required)
     <volume name>:

           # Structure item name. There's an implementation-specific constraint
           # on the maximum length. The maximum length of a partition name
           # for GPT is 36 characters in the UTF-16 character set. (optional)
           name: <name>

           # GPT unique partition id, disallowed on MBR volumes. (optional)
           id: <id>

           # Role defines a special role for this item in the image. (optional)
           # Must be either unset, or one of:
           #   mbr - Master Boot Record of the image.
           #   system-seed - Partition holding first-stage/recovery boot loader and at
           #                 least one recovery system containing the following
           #                 set of snaps: base, kernel, gadget and application snaps
           #   system-boot - Partition holding the boot assets.
           #   system-data - Partition holding the main operating system data.
           #   system-boot-image - Partition holding kernel images for the Little Kernel bootloader.
           #   system-boot-select - Partition holding state for snapd Little Kernel support.
           #   system-save - Partition for Ubuntu Core 20 to store backup data relative to device
           #                 identity and to facilitate recovery or re-install.
           #

.. _gadget-snaps-prepare:

prepare-device hook
-------------------

The optional ``prepare-device`` hook will be called on the gadget at the start of the device initialisation process, after the gadget snap has been installed.

The hook will also be called if this process is retried later from scratch in case of initialisation failures.

The device initialisation process is, for example, responsible for setting the serial identification of the device through an exchange with a device service.

The ``prepare-device`` hook can for example redirect this exchange and dynamically set options relevant to it.

One must ensure that ``registration.proposed-serial`` is set to a *unique value* across all devices of the brand and model and that it does not contain a ``/``. It is going to be used as the “serial number” (a string, not necessarily a number) part of the identification in case the device service supports setting it or **requires** it, as is the case with the *serial-vault*.


.. _gadget-snaps-example-prepare:

Example: prepare-device hook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

   #!/bin/sh

   # optionally set the url of the service
   snapctl set device-service.url="https://device-service"

   # set optional extra HTTP headers for requests to the service
   snapctl set device-service.headers='{"api-key": "API-KEY-VALUE"}'

   # set an optional proposed serial identifier, depending on the service
   # this can end up being ignored
   #
   # this might need to be obtained dynamically. as the expected value must be a JSON string
   # one must be careful with proper shell quotation especially if using command
   # substitution, e.g.:
   #   snapctl set registration.proposed-serial='"'"$(get-serial-number)"'"'
   snapctl set registration.proposed-serial="DEVICE-SERIAL"

   # optionally pass details of the device as the body of registration request,
   # the body is text, typically YAML;

   # this might need to be obtained dynamically
   snapctl set registration.body='mac: "00:00:00:00:ff:00"'
