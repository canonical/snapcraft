Snap publishing process
=======================

After a snap is built, it's ready for distribution in a package store. Authors
who wish to make their snaps public can use of the official `Snap Store
<https://snapcraft.io/>`_, hosted and curated by Canonical.

Prior to engaging with the Snap Store, authors must first create a free
developer account. Before they publish a new snap to the store, they must
register their snap's name to reserve it.

The Snap Store comes with a high level of release management flexibility,
achieved by using multiple :ref:`channels <channels>`, which allow developers
to publish their apps in a staged, controlled manner. The channels can be
treated as concurrent software releasing and version control.
