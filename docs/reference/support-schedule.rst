Major versions of Snapcraft are supported in three phases:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Year
      - Support commitment
    * - 1--5
      - LTS Standard Security Maintenance, consisting of new features and bug and
        security fixes.
    * - 5--10
      - LTS Expanded Security Maintenance, consisting of bug and security fixes.
    * - 10--15
      - Legacy add-on for Ubuntu Pro subscribers, consisting of security fixes.

Each major version of Snapcraft supports the latest core and two previous cores
available at time of release. One future core is also tentatively supported, provided it
passes a testing phase. For example, Snapcraft 8 was released with support for the
then-current core24, with legacy support for core20 and core22. Later, it gained
experimental support for core26.
