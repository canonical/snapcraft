.. _build-providers-1:

Build providers
---------------

-  Disable automatic snap refreshes inside instances
-  LXD instances launch from a cached base instance rather than a base image. This reduces disk usage and launch time.
-  For the LXD launch function launched_environment, the parameter use_snapshots has been replaced by use_base_instance. use_snapshots still works but logs a deprecation notice.
-  Expire and recreate base instances older than 3 months (90 days)
-  Check for network connectivity after network-related commands fails
-  Set LXD id maps after launching or copying an instance
-  Raise BaseConfigurationError for snap refresh failures
-  Check LXD id map before starting an existing instance. If the id map does not match, the instance will be auto cleaned or an error will be raised.
