The netlink-driver interface
============================

The ``netlink-driver`` interface allows a kernel module to expose itself to user-space via the Netlink protocol, typically to transfer information between the kernel and user-space processes.

See also :ref:`netlink-audit <the-netlink-audit-interface>` and :ref:`netlink-connector <the-netlink-connector-interface>`.

.. note::


          See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
