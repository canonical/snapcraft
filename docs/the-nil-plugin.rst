The nil plugin
==============

The ``nil`` plugin does not run any language-specific packaging logic, and is useful for parts with no source, or for parts with sources that don’t need to be compiled or packed.

By using the *nil* plugin, parts can be defined purely by using properties automatically included by Snapcraft, such as ``stage-packages``.

For examples, search `GitHub <https://github.com/search?q=path%3Asnapcraft.yaml+%22plugin%3A+nil%22&type=Code>`__ for projects already using the plugin.

   ⓘ This is a *snapcraft* plugin. See :ref:`Snapcraft plugins <snapcraft-plugins>` and :ref:`Supported plugins <supported-plugins>` for further details on how plugins are used.
