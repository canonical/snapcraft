The gpio-control interface
==========================

``gpio-control`` allows the control of all aspects of GPIO pins.

This interface can potentially impact the system and other snaps, and allows privileged access to hardware. See :ref:`The gpio interface <the-gpio-interface>` to access a specific pin.

:ref:`Auto-connect <interface-management-auto-connections>`: no

:ref:`Super-privileged <super-privileged-interfaces>`: yes

Requires snapd version *2.41+*.

   â“˜ This is a snap interface. See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
