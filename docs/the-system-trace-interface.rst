The system-trace interface
==========================

``system-trace`` enables the monitoring and control of any running program, via kernel tracing facilities. This interface is restricted because it gives privileged access to all processes on the system and should only be used with trusted apps.

**Auto-connect**: no

   â“˜ This is a snap interface. See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
