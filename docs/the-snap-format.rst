The snap format
===============

   ℹ This page documents the format of the **built** snaps. See :ref:`The snapcraft format <the-snapcraft-yaml-schema>` for more information about the ``snapcraft.yaml`` file used to build these snaps.

A snap is a *SquashFS* file carrying content alongside metadata to tell the system how it should be manipulated. When installed, the SquashFS file for the snap is mounted read-only at the following location:

``/snap/<snap name>/<revision>/``

This method delivers fast and extremely predictable installations, with no installation remnants, and no way for a snap’s content to be mutated or interfered with. A snap is either installed and available as originally built, or it is not available at all.

Applications declared in the snap become commands at:

``/snap/bin/<snap name>[.<app name>]``

The suffix is omitted if ``<app name>`` matches ``<snap name>``.

That snap command file is not the actual application, but rather a link to the real application under the isolation and confinement rules of the snap’s default restricted environment, plus any allowances granted to it via the interface system.

Setup files
-----------

The following files control the behaviour of a snap:

-  ``meta/snap.yaml``: Basic snap details (see below)
-  ``meta/hooks/``: Hooks called on specific events (see below)
-  ``meta/gui/icon.{svg,png}``: Icon for the snap
-  ``meta/gui/*.desktop``: Desktop files for the snap (see below)

snap.yaml
~~~~~~~~~

Every snap package contains a ``meta/snap.yaml`` file that holds the basic metadata for the snap.

Please take note of this important distinction:

-  **snap.yaml** lives inside every snap package, read by snapd
-  **snapcraft.yaml** contains instructions to create a snap package, read by the *snapcraft* command used to build snaps

Most of the metadata supported by *snap.yaml* is optional. In fact, the simplest ``snap.yaml`` could contain as little as the following:

.. code:: yaml

   name: simplest
   version: 1.0

An example *snap.yaml* that offers an application to run is still very simple:

.. code:: yaml

   name: simple
   version: 1.0
   apps:
       hello:
           command: bin/hello --world

The following is the complete specification for the metadata in *snap.yaml*:

.. code:: yaml

   # The suggested snap name, constrained to the [a-z0-9] charset and inner
   # dashes. The final name when the snap is installed is defined by the
   # snap-declaration assertion associated with the snap, if any.
   name: <name>

   # An optional title for the snap, may contain uppercase letters and spaces.
   title: <title>

   # Version of the software packed inside the snap. Has no semantic value
   # in the system (no greater/lower-than rules are ever applied to it).
   version: <version>

   # More details about what is contained in the snap.
   summary: <line>
   description: <text>

   # License for the snap content, based on SPDX license expressions.

   # Type of snap, defaults to "app".

   # The base snap that defines the underlying filesystem this snap
   # will be assembled on top of.
   base: <name>


   # A list of features that must be supported by the core for
   # the snap to install. For example, the following sets a requirement for

Hooks
-----

Hooks provide a mechanism for snapd to alert snaps that something has happened, or to ask the snap to provide its opinion about an operation that is in progress. See the topic on :ref:`supported hooks <supported-snap-hooks>` for more details.

Interfaces
----------

Interfaces allow snaps to communicate or share resources according to the protocol established by the interface. They play an important part in security policy configuration.

See :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for more details.

Layouts
-------

Layouts enable snap developers to modify the execution environment of their snap. They simplify the process of using pre-compiled binaries and libraries that expect to find files and directories outside of locations referenced by $SNAP or $SNAP_DATA.

For more details, see :ref:`Snap layouts <snap-layouts>`.

Desktop files
-------------

The ``meta/gui/`` directory (``snap/gui/`` with snapcraft) may contain ``*.desktop`` files for the snap. These desktop files may contain valid desktop entries from the XDG Desktop Entry Specification version 1.1 with some exceptions listed below. Lines with unknown keys are silently removed from the desktop file on install.

The *Exec=* line must use the following syntax:

``Exec=<snap name>[.<app name>] [<argument> ...]``

As in the executables contained under ``/snap/bin``, the ``.<app name>`` suffix is omitted if the application name and snap name are the same.

For example, assuming this content in ``snap.yaml``:

.. code:: yaml

   name: http
   version: 1.0
   apps:
       get:
           command: bin/my-downloader

… the following desktop file would be valid:

.. code:: yaml

   [Desktop Entry]
   Name=My Downloader
   Exec=http.get %U


.. _the-snap-format-autostart:

Autostart desktop files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An application may put a desktop file under ``$SNAP_USER_DATA/.config/autostart`` in order to be automatically started with the user’s desktop session. The file is matched with a corresponding application based on the ``autostart`` property of an app inside ``meta/snap.yaml``. For example:

.. code:: yaml

   name: my-chat
   version: 1.0
   apps:
       chat:
           command: bin/my-chat
           autostart: my-chat.desktop

Assuming ``my-chat`` has written a file ``$SNAP_USER_DATA/.config/autostart/my-chat.desktop`` with the following contents:

.. code:: yaml

   [Desktop Entry]
   Name=My Chat
   Exec=/usr/bin/my-chat --autostart a b c

The *Exec=* line is used to obtain any command line parameters, and the application will be started as: ``my-chat.chat --autostart a b c``

Unsupported desktop keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``DBusActivatable``, ``TryExec`` and ``Implements`` keys are currently not supported and will be silently removed from the desktop file on install.
