New Features
------------

ROS 1 Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new ROS 1 :ref:`extension <snapcraft-extensions>` allows you to target ``core20`` with ROS 1 *Noetic Ninjemys*, the latest (and last) ROS 1 LTS that runs on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa).

You can now build a ROS 1 application with a ``snapcraft.yaml`` as simple as:

.. code:: yaml

   name: catkin-noetic-hello
   version: "1.0"
   summary: hello world
   description: |
     A ROS 1 roscpp-based workspace.
   grade: stable
   confinement: strict
   base: core20

   apps:
     catkin-noetic-hello:
       command: opt/ros/noetic/lib/snapcraft_hello/snapcraft_hello
       plugs: [network, network-bind]
       extensions: [ros1-noetic]

   parts:
     hello:
       plugin: catkin
       source: .
       build-packages: [g++, make]

It’s operation and functionality is similar to the newly introduced :ref:`ROS 2 extension <the-ros2-foxy-extension>`, and the associated colcon plugin, added in :ref:`Snapcraft 4.2 <release-notes-snapcraft-4-2>`.

Set the default Channel Track
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is now possible to set a `default track <https://snapcraft.io/docs/using-tracks>`__ for your snap:

.. code:: bash

   $ snapcraft set-default-track <snap-name> 17
   Default track for '<snap-name>' set to '17'

This features complements the ability to list channel tracks, which as added in :ref:`Snapcraft 4.2 <release-notes-snapcraft-4-2>`.
