The nodejs plugin
=================

The ``nodejs`` plugin is useful when working with `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/>`__ and `npm <https://www.npmjs.com/>`__ JavaScript based parts.

This plugin can only be used with a :ref:`base <base-snaps>` of either ``core18`` and ``core``. For ``core20`` and ``core22``, use the :ref:`npm <the-npm-plugin>` plugin instead.

Additional features and syntax are dependent on which :ref:`base <base-snaps>` is being used, as outlined below:

The plugin uses *node* to install dependencies from ``package.json``. It also sets up binaries defined in ``package.json`` by adding them to ``PATH``.

This plugin uses the common plugin keywords as well as those for “sources”. For more information, see :ref:`Snapcraft parts metadata <snapcraft-parts-metadata>`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin uses the following plugin-specific keywords:

-  **nodejs-version** (string; default: 8.12.0) The version of *node.js* you want the snap to run on. For example: ``nodejs-version: 8.12.0``
-  **nodejs-package-manager** (string; default: yarn) The language package manager to use to drive installation of node packages. Can be either ``npm`` or ``yarn`` (default).
-  **nodejs-yarn-version** (string) The version of the *yarn* package manager to use to drive installation of node packages. Currently, this must start with a *v*, for example: ``nodejs-yarn-version: v1.19.1``

For examples, search `GitHub <https://github.com/search?q=path%3Asnapcraft.yaml+%22plugin%3A+nodejs%22&type=Code>`__ for projects already using the plugin.

Requires Snapcraft version *3.x*.
