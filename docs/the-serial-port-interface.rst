The serial-port interface
=========================

The ``serial-port`` interface enables input and output access to a specific serial port on a device typically running :ref:`glossary-ubuntu-core`. As a result, and because it provides such privileged access to configure serial port hardware, ``serial-port`` is considered a restricted interface.

Use ``snap interface serial-port`` to see which serial-port devices are available on the system:

.. code:: bash

   $ snap interface serial-port
   name:    serial-port
   summary: allows accessing a specific serial port
   slots:
     - core:model01 (allows accessing a specific serial port)
     - core:monome (allows accessing a specific serial port)

Once connected, the consuming snap can use the device via the path specified by the connected slot.

.. note::


          See :ref:`interface-management` and :ref:`supported-interfaces` for further details on how interfaces are used.

Developer details
-----------------

**Auto-Connect**: no

**Attributes**:

- Should specify a single path attribute:
   * ``path`` (slot): path to serial device node e.g. ``/dev/ttyS1``

-  Or three attributes:

   -  ``usb-vendor`` (slot): integer representing the USB Vendor ID, must be in range 0 < vid <= 65535
   -  ``usb-product`` (slot): integer representing the USB Product ID, must be in range 0 <= vid <= 65535
   -  ``path`` (slot): path of the form ``/dev/serial-port-...`` where a symlink will be created to the device e.g. ``/dev/serial-port-mydevice``

:ref:`Hardware IO interfaces <hardware-io-interfaces>` covers some general considerations common to these kinds of devices.

To use a serial-port device, the snap developer must add ``plugs: [ serial-port ]`` to a snap’s :ref:`snapcraft.yaml <the-snapcraft-yaml-schema>`. The snap user can then access a specific serial-port device with an :ref:`interface connection <interface-management-manual-connections>`.

Code examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example shows the slot configuration, such as from the gadget snap, and includes which snaps are permitted to connect automatically:

.. code:: yaml

   serial-port:
       allow-auto-connection:
         -
           on-store:
             - (whatever)
           plug-names:
             - serial-foo
           plug-snap-id:
             - foooVbn5YriRw2sRVw7Cuj5PbjJjwnFb
           slot-attributes:
             path: /dev/whatever
           slot-names:
             - serial-foo

All attributes must match for an auto-connection attempt to be successful. The above example requires a connecting snap to have a matching snap-id and plug name. For example, the following snapcraft.yaml stanza for the connecting snap would *not* connect:

.. code:: yaml

   apps:
     whatever:
        plugs:
           serial-port

While the following snapcraft.yaml stanza for the connecting snap would automatically connect:

.. code:: yaml

   apps:
     whatever:
        plugs:
           serial-foo
   plugs:
      serial-foo:
         interface: serial-port

The test code can be found in the snapd repository: `serial_port_test.go <https://github.com/snapcore/snapd/blob/master/interfaces/builtin/serial_port_test.go>`__.

The source code for the interface is in the snapd repository: `serial_port.go <https://github.com/snapcore/snapd/blob/master/interfaces/builtin/serial_port.go>`__\
