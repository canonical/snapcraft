The home interface
==================

The ``home`` :ref:`interface <interface-management>` allows access to non-hidden files owned by the user in the user’s home ($HOME) directory where a user normally stores their personal files and documents.

The majority of snaps use :ref:`strict confinement <snap-confinement>` and do not have arbitrary access a system’s resources, including file and directories in the */home* directory. Without this access, *home* will not be visible in file requesters, or as a destination from within the snap application.

To check whether a snap can connect to $HOME, use the *snap connections* command:

.. code:: bash

   $ snap connections <snap-name>
   Interface  Plug                Slot         Notes
   home       <snap-name>:home    -        -

The above output shows that ``<snap-name>`` does provide a home interface (in the *Plug* column), but that it’s not connected to any slot (denoted by the ``-`` in the slot column).

Use the *snap connect* command to connect an interface:

.. code:: bash

   $ snap connect <snap-name>:home :home

The ``:home`` slot, with no <snap-name> before the colon (``:``) is equivalent to directing the plug to connect to the system, which in this case is the $HOME directory.

A snap developer can :ref:`request permission <permission-requests>` to have the ``home`` interface connected automatically. In this case, non-hidden files and directories will be accessible from that snap without any further configuration being necessary.

Requires snapd version *2.33+*.

.. note::


          This is a snap interface. See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.

Developer details
-----------------

:ref:`Auto-Connect <the-interface-auto-connection-mechanism-autoconnect>`:

- **yes** on traditional distributions
- **no** on all other systems, including :ref:`glossary-ubuntu-core`

**Transitional**: yes

**Attributes**:

* ``read`` (plug): optional, when set to ‘all’, also allows reading non-hidden files in the home directories of all users as traditional file permissions allow. *When set to ‘all’ this plug becomes non-autoconnect.*
