Documentation guidelines
========================

Our documentation is a community effort, `published <https://docs.snapcraft.io>`__ via the `Discourse <https://www.discourse.org/>`__ forum hosted at `forum.snapcraft.io <https://forum.snapcraft.io>`__. We warmly welcome community contributions, suggestions, fixes and constructive feedback.

The navigational structure, style, and content of our documentation follows the :ref:`documentation-guidelines-diataxis` systematic framework for technical documentation authoring. This splits documentation pages into tutorials, how-to guides, reference material and explanatory text.

Our `Documentation roadmap <https://snapcraft.io/docs/documentation-roadmap>`__ outlines both our short-term and long-term goals for Snap-related documentation.

Feel free to modify any `documentation topic <https://forum.snapcraft.io/c/doc>`__ with updated or more insightful information. If you already participate in the snap community, you don’t need additional permissions; pages are freely editable within the forum itself. Of course, feel free to ask and discuss when appropriate.

Documentation consistency is vital, which is why we’re listing some guidelines below, but don’t let this formality put you off - just start writing and editing. If something is inconsistent, we’ll fix it.

As `Voltaire <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire>`__ wrote, “*Perfect is the enemy of good*,” and we’d rather have documentation we can fix than non-existent documentation we can’t.

Style and language
------------------

One of our biggest challenges is accommodating an audience with a huge variation in experience, from beginners exploring the *snap* command, through snap creators experimenting with *snapcraft.yaml*, to experts harnessing the API and deploying snaps across thousands of IoT devices.

Consequently, we try to:

- pitch the writing and editing appropriately for the subject
- write inclusively and assume very little prior knowledge of the reader
- link or explain phrases, acronyms and concepts that may be unfamiliar, and if unsure, err on the side of caution

Some general tips:

- use a spell checker
- resist being overly formal
- resist being overly verbose
- verify links and examples

We (mostly) adhere to the `Ubuntu style guide <https://docs.ubuntu.com/styleguide/en>`__. In particular:

- we use British English (en-GB), for example:
- the *ise* suffix in preference to *ize* (*capitalise* rather than *capitalize*)
- *our* instead of *or* (as in *colour* and *color*)
- license as a verb, licence as a noun
- catalogue rather than catalog
- dates take the format *1 January 2013*, *1-2 January 2013* and *1 January - 2 February 2013*

Diátaxis
--------

Our navigational structure, style, and the content of our documentation follows the `Diátaxis <https://diataxis.fr/>`__ systematic framework for technical documentation authoring. This splits documentation pages into tutorials, how-to guides, reference material and explanatory text:

-  **Tutorials** are lessons that accomplish specific tasks through *doing*. They help with familiarity and place users in the safe hands of an instructor.
-  **How-to guides** are recipes, showing users how to achieve something, helping them get something done. A *How-to* has no obligation to teach.
-  **Reference** material is descriptive, providing facts about functionality that is isolated from what needs to be done.
-  **Explanation** is discussion, helping users gain a deeper or better understanding of Snap and Snapcraft, along with how and why they function as they do.

For further details on our Diátaxis strategy, see `Diátaxis, a new foundation for Canonical documentation <https://ubuntu.com/blog/diataxis-a-new-foundation-for-canonical-documentation>`__.

Improving our documentation and applying the principles of Diátaxis are on-going tasks. There’s a lot to do, and we don’t want to deter anyone from contributing to our docs. If you don’t know whether something should be a tutorial, how-to, reference doc or explanatory text, either ask on the forum or publish what you’re thinking. Changes are easy to make, and every contribution helps.
