The system-files interface
==========================

The ``system-files`` interface enables a snap to access specific system files and directories (such as files in ``/etc``). Consequently, the interface can provide access to privileged system data and is not connected by default.

This interface is typically used to provide read-only access to system configuration directories created by a non-snap version of an application now running from an equivalent snap.

Example
-------

The `Firefox <https://snapcraft.io/firefox>`__, `Chromium <https://snapcraft.io/chromium>`__ and `Thunderbird <https://snapcraft.io/thunderbird>`__ snaps use this interface to enable access to system-installed policies to customise each respective application.

.. note::


          See :ref:`interface-management` and :ref:`supported-interfaces` for further details on how interfaces are used.

Developer details
-----------------

:ref:`Auto-connect <interface-management-auto-connections>`: no

:ref:`Super-privileged <super-privileged-interfaces>`: yes

**Transitional**: no

**Attributes**:

* ``read`` (plug): list of files and/or directories for read-only access (eg, ‘``read: [ /etc/file-read, /etc/dir-read ]``’
* ``write`` (plug): list of files and/or directories for read/write access (eg, ‘``write: [ /etc/file-write, /etc/dir-write ]``’

Requires snapd version *2.37+*.

Consumers of this interface require a `snap declaration <https://snapcraft.io/docs/process-for-aliases-auto-connections-and-tracks>`__ for distribution via the `Snap Store <https://snapcraft.io/store>`__ and acceptance in the store requires that the interface is not be used to access:

- system files where the snap is not the clear owner (eg, /dev, /proc, /sys, /usr, etc).
- paths in ``/dev``, such as ``/dev/sda1`` Access to ``/dev`` device nodes requires both AppArmor policy and device control group inclusion, but the *system-files* interface does not have enough information to generate the necessary policy to enable these use cases. As such, purpose-specific interfaces should be used instead, such as :ref:`block-devices <the-block-devices-interface>` or :ref:`raw-volume <the-raw-volume-interface>`.

.. note::
          Do not share data between snaps. While ``system-files`` can be used to share data with another snap, such as within a configuration file, this behaviour is not recommended. The :ref:`content interface <the-content-interface>` should be used instead.



An additional requirement for acceptance in the Global store is using a descriptive interface reference for use with ``snap connections|interfaces|connect|disconnect``.

For example, the ‘foo’ application is packaged as a snap and the snap publisher wants to import existing configuration from ``/etc/foo`` into the snap. The snapcraft.yaml might be:

::

   name: foo
   ...
   plugs:
     etc-foo:
       interface: system-files
       read:
       - /etc/foo

   apps:
     foo:
       plugs:
       - etc-foo
       ...

Note, when declaring an instance of the ``system-files`` plug as above, it should be named with a descriptive name that indicates to a user what access it grants. In this case, the name ``etc-foo`` is used to reflect the access to ``/etc/foo``.

With the above, a ``snap connect`` command would look like: ``snap connect foo:etc-foo``.
