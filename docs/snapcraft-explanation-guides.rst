          **NOTE TO EDITORS**

          This topic is currently under construction as we start to migrate our current documentation to use the `Diátaxis <https://diataxis.fr/>`__ framework.

          See `Diátaxis, a new foundation for Canonical documentation <https://ubuntu.com/blog/diataxis-a-new-foundation-for-canonical-documentation>`__ for more details.



Our explanatory and conceptual guides are written to provide a better understanding of how Snapcraft works and the principles behind its build system and syntax. They enable you to expand your knowledge and become better at both building snaps and getting the most out of the snap ecosystem.

For a simpler place to start your Snapcraft journey, our tutorials section contains step-by-step tutorials to help outline what Snapcraft is capable of while helping you achieve specific aims, such as installing Snapcraft or building your first snap.

If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with Snapcraft, our *How-to* guides have more in-depth detail than our tutorials and can be applied to a broader set of applications. They’ll help you achieve an end-result but may require you to understand and adapt the steps to fit your specific requirements.

Take a look at our *Reference section* when you need to know which interfaces can be used and what plugins Snapcraft supports.
