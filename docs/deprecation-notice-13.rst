Deprecation notice: 13
======================

(DRAFT)

Support will be removed for legacy and core-based projects in Snapcraft 5.0 (expected July 22, 2021).

To continue using the core base, Snapcraft has opened a legacy ``4.x`` track that maintains compatibility going forward. You may switch to this track using: ``snap refresh snapcraft --channel=4.x/stable``

We highly recommend migrating your snap to core20. For more information on migrating to core20, check out: migrating-between-bases.md
