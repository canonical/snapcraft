The io-ports-control interface
==============================

**Auto-connect**: no

Requires snapd version *2.21+*.

   â“˜ This is a snap interface. See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
