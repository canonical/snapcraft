  Creating an inclusive work environment is imperative to a healthy,
  supportive, and productive culture, and an environment where everyone feels
  welcome and included. woke is a text file analysis tool that finds places
  within your source code that contain non-inclusive language and suggests
  replacing them with more inclusive alternatives.
