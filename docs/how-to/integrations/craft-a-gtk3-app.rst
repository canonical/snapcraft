Craft a GTK3 app
================

This how-to guide covers the steps, decisions, and implementation details that
are unique when crafting a snap of an app built using GTK3 and GNOME. We'll
work through the aspects unique to GTK3-based apps by examining an existing
project file.


Example foliate project file
----------------------------

The following code comprises the project file of a GTK3 app, `foliate
<https://github.com/johnfactotum/foliate>`_. This project is an e-book reader.

.. collapse:: foliate project file

    .. literalinclude:: ../code/integrations/example-gtk3-recipe.yaml
        :caption: snapcraft.yaml
        :language: yaml
        :lines: 2-


Add an app that uses GNOME
--------------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../code/integrations/example-gtk3-recipe.yaml
    :caption: snapcraft.yaml
    :language: yaml
    :start-at: apps:
    :end-at: common-id: com.github.johnfactotum.Foliate

Apps that use GTK3 and GNOME as runtime libraries require the `gnome-3-38
extension <https://snapcraft.io/docs/gnome-3-38-extension>`_. The extension
configures the runtime environment of the app so that all desktop functionality
is correctly initialised. As desktop environment apps, they also need special
configuration for AppStream and ``.desktop`` file compatibility.

To add a GTK4 app:

#. Declare the general app keys, such as ``command``,
   ``plugs``, ``after``, and so on.
#. For ``extensions``, add ``gnome-3-38``.
#. Set ``common-id`` to the app's unique AppStream ID. Doing so links the app
   to the ``.desktop`` launcher specified in the AppStream file.
#. If the app requires access to D-Bus, for ``slots``, add ``dbus-daemon``.


Add a part written for GTK3
---------------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../code/integrations/example-gtk3-recipe.yaml
    :caption: snapcraft.yaml
    :language: yaml
    :start-at: parts:
    :end-at: parse-info: [usr/share/metainfo/com.github.johnfactotum.Foliate.appdata.xml]

GTK3 parts are built with the `Meson plugin
<https://snapcraft.io/docs/meson-plugin>`_.

To add a GTK4 part:

#. Declare the general part keys, such as ``source``, ``override-build``,
   ``build-packages``, and so on.
#. Set ``plugin: meson``.
#. So that the app has access to its AppStream metadata, for ``parse-info`` add
   a path to the AppStream ``.xml`` file on the host system. Since we set
   ``adopt-info: foliate`` at the start of the project file, the AppStream
   file of the ``foliate`` part will be used to fill in the
   ``summary``, ``description`` and ``icon`` of this snap and copy the
   AppStream file. See `Using AppStream metadata
   <https://snapcraft.io/docs/using-external-metadata#heading--appstream>`_ for
   technical details about how this works.


Add required slots
------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../code/integrations/example-gtk3-recipe.yaml
    :caption: snapcraft.yaml
    :language: yaml
    :lines: 39-
    :end-at: name: com.github.johnfactotum.Foliate

Many GTK3 apps require access to DBus in order to run correctly. If your app
does, you need to explicitly grant it access as a slot:

#. Declare the slot key.
#. Set ``interface: dbus`` and ``bus: session``.
#. Set ``name`` to the app's AppStream ID.
