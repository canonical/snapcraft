Desktop App support - Qt
========================

Snapping Qt applications
------------------------

Use the following guides to create a new snap for a graphical application which uses `Qt <https://www.qt.io/>`__. These guides use the stable Qt versions which are shipped with Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 LTS and are recommended for most applications and new snaps.

-  :ref:`Desktop App support - Qt5 <deprecated-desktop-app-support-qt5>`
-  :ref:`Desktop App support - Qt4 <desktop-app-support-qt4>`

[legacy] snaps that donâ€™t use ``base``
--------------------------------------

If you have an existing snap that does not use the `base <https://snapcraft.io/docs/base-snaps>`__ functionality, please use the following guide.

-  :ref:`[Legacy] Desktop App support - Qt for snaps without bases <desktop-app-support-qt-for-snaps-without-bases>`

Snapping KDE applications
-------------------------

The KDE community has developed tools to help them snap the `KDE applications <https://kde.org/applications/>`__. These applications require the latest version of Qt and the `KDE frameworks <https://kde.org/products/frameworks/>`__ which are not provided by Ubuntu LTS. Use the following guide to snap a KDE application using the latest libraries.

-  `Desktop App support - KDE applications <https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Snap>`__

*Note: this method is not recommended for regular Qt applications, as it is specifically tailored towards KDE applications.*
