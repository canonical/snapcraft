Remote builds: ``--build-for`` and shorthand platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, the :ref:`remote builder <explanation-remote-build>` couldn't accept the
``--build-for`` argument when building core24 snaps with a shorthand :ref:`platforms
<reference_architectures>` definition.

Due to improvements made by the Launchpad team, ``--build-for`` can now be used when
building core24 snaps remotely.
