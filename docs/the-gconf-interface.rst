The gconf interface
===================

The ``gconf`` interface allows access to any item from the legacy `GConf configuration system <https://gitlab.gnome.org/Archive/gconf>`__ for the current user, typically used by old GNOME desktop libraries and applications.

This interface needs to be manually connected because *gconf* is a global database for GNOME desktop and application settings and offers no application isolation.

.. note::


          See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
