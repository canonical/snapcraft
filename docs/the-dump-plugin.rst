The dump plugin
===============

This plugin dumps the content from a specified source.

You can specify various details about such a source using :ref:`source keywords <snapcraft-parts-metadata-source>`, such as ``source`` and ``source-type``.

This plugin uses also :ref:`common plugin keywords <snapcraft-parts-metadata>`. Such keywords can, for example, be useful when the dumped content needs to be mangled or organised in some way. Using keywords such as ``filesets``, ``stage``, ``snap`` and ``organize`` can be useful in such cases.

For example:

.. code:: yaml

   parts:
     my-part:
       source: local-source/
       plugin: dump
       organize:
         '*.png' : images/
         launch.wrapper: usr/bin/launcher
       prime:
         - -README*
     remote-part:
       source: https://remote-resource.org/cool-package.deb
       source-type: deb
