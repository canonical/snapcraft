The ptp interface
=================

The ``ptp`` interface allows access to the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) `Hardware Clock subsystem <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/ptp/ptp.txt>`__ in the Linux kernel, enabling the clock to be synced to sub-100 nanoseconds.

This interface is primarily intended to be used with :ref:`glossary-ubuntu-core`.

.. note::


          See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
