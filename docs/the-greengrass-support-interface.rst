The greengrass-support interface
================================

``greengrass-support`` allows operating as the Greengrass service to access resources and syscalls necessary to run Amazon Greengrass services and lambda functions. Snaps specifying this interface can currently only be established with the Amazon Greengrass project.

:ref:`Super-privileged <super-privileged-interfaces>`: yes

Requires snapd version *2.26+*.

   â“˜ This is a snap interface. See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
