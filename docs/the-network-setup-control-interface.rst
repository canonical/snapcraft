The network-setup-control interface
===================================

``network-setup-control`` allows read/write access to Netplan configuration files. This is restricted because it gives access to system network configuration which can contain network security details.

**Auto-connect**: no

Requires snapd version *2.22+*.

   â“˜ This is a snap interface. See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
