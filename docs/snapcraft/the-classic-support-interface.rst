The classic-support interface
=============================

The ``classic-support`` interface sets special permissions for the `classic snap <https://snapcraft.io/classic>`__, effectively giving device ownership to its connected snaps.

This interface is intended to be used only with :ref:`glossary-ubuntu-core`.

Requires snapd version *2.23+*.

.. note::


          See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
