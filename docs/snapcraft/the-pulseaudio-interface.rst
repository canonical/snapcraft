The pulseaudio interface
========================

   ⚠ As of snapd 2.41, this interface is deprecated and the :ref:`audio-playback <the-audio-playback-interface>` and :ref:`audio-record <the-audio-record-interface>` interfaces should be used instead. They provide access to PulseAudio and will provide access to other sound servers in the future.

``pulseaudio`` enables access to the PulseAudio sound server for sound playback and recording.

**Auto-connect**: no

*Note: The* :ref:`audio-playback <the-audio-playback-interface>` *interface is auto-connected.*

   ⓘ This is a snap interface. See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
