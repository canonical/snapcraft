Snapcraft parts metadata
========================

The main building blocks of a snap are *parts*. They are used to declare pieces of code that will be pulled into your snap package. The *parts* keys and values in :ref:`snapcraft.yaml <the-snapcraft-yaml-schema>` detail how parts are configured and built by the *snapcraft* command.

   See :ref:`Snapcraft top-level metadata <snapcraft-top-level-metadata>` and :ref:`Snapcraft apps and services metadata <snapcraft-app-and-service-metadata>` for details on how apps and parts are configured within *snapcraft.yaml*.

parts
-----

Type: ``dict``

A set of independent building blocks.

These independent building blocks are known as *parts*, and consist of either code or pre-built packages.

parts.<part-name>
-----------------

Type: ``dict``

The name of the part building block.

``<part-name``> represents the specific name of a building block which can be then referenced by the command-line tool (i.e. ``snapcraft``).

Keys for parts
--------------

The following are keys that can be used within **parts.** (for example, ``parts.<part-name>.plugin``):

after
~~~~~

Type: ``list[string]``

Ensures that all the <part-names> listed in ``after`` are staged before this part begins its :ref:`lifecycle <parts-lifecycle-steps>`.


.. _snapcraft-parts-metadata-build-attributes:

build-attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Type: ``enum``

A list of named attributes to modify the behaviour of plugins.

Supported attributes:

-  ``debug``: Plugins that support the concept of build types build in Release mode by default. Setting the ‘debug’ attribute requests that they instead build in debug mode.
-  ``keep-execstack``: Do not remove the “executable stack” bit from ELF files.
-  ``no-patchelf``: Do not patch ELF files, even when Snapcraft believes it is required (e.g. for classic snaps)
-  ``enable-patchelf``: Do patch ELF files, even when Snapcraft does not believe it’s required (e.g. for strict snaps)
-  ``no-install``: Do not run the install target provided by the plugin’s build system. *(Only supported by the* :ref:`kbuild plugin <the-kbuild-plugin>` *)*

For more information, refer to the output of ``snapcraft help plugins``.


.. _snapcraft-parts-metadata-build-environment:

build-environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Type: Array

A list of environment variable assignments that are applied during the build step, `it is exported in order which allows for later values to override (or modify) earlier values. <https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/pull/2322>`__

         - LC_ALL: C.UTF-8

build-packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Type: ``list[string]``

A list of packages required to build a snap.

Packages are installed using the host’s package manager, such as ``apt`` or ``dnf``, and are required for <part-name> to build correctly. This entry supports additional syntax, for more information refer to :ref:`Advanced grammar <snapcraft-advanced-grammar>`.

Example: ``[ libssl-dev, libssh-dev, libncursesw5-dev]``


.. _snapcraft-parts-metadata-build-snaps:

build-snaps
~~~~~~~~~~~

Type: ``list[string]``

A list of snap names to install that are necessary to build ``<part-name>``.

If a specific channel is required, the syntax is of the form ``<snap-name>/<channel>``. This entry supports additional syntax, for more information refer to :ref:`Advanced grammar <snapcraft-advanced-grammar>`

Example: ``build-snaps: [go/1.13/stable]``

The shell script defined here replaces the :ref:`build <parts-lifecycle-steps>` step of the plugin, defined in ``parts.<part-name>.plugin``. The working directory is the base build directory for the given part. The defined script is run with ``/bin/sh`` and ``set -e``. A set of :ref:`Environment Variables <environment-variables>` will be available to the script.

To run Snapcraft’s original build implementation from within *override-build*, run ``snapcraftctl build``. This can be run before or after any custom script or omitted entirely.


.. _snapcraft-parts-metadata-override-prime:

override-prime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Type: ``multiline string``

Replaces a plugin’s default *prime* process with a script.

The shell script defined here replaces the :ref:`prime <parts-lifecycle-steps>` step of the plugin, defined in ``parts.<part-name>.plugin``.

See :ref:`Using external metadata <using-external-metadata>` for more details.

plugin
~~~~~~

Type: ``string``

The plugin to drive the build process.

Every part drives its build through a plugin, this entry declares the plugin that will drive the build process for ``<part-name>``.

prepare (deprecated)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Type: ``multiline string``

Runs a script before the plugin’s :ref:`build <parts-lifecycle-steps>` step.

The script is run before the build step defined for ``parts.<part-name>.plugin`` starts. The working directory is the base build directory for the given part. The defined script is run with ``/bin/sh`` and ``set -e``. A set of :ref:`Environment Variables <environment-variables>` will be available to the script.

   ⚠ The release of :ref:`Snapcraft 3.0 <release-notes-snapcraft-3-0>` made this key obsolete. Use `override-build <snapcraft-parts-metadata-override-build_>`__ instead.

Type: ``integer``

Depth of history for sources using version control.

Source repositories under version control are cloned or checked out with full history. Specifying a depth will truncate the history to the specified number of commits.

source-subdir

   parts:
     git-test:
       plugin: dump
       source-type: git
