New Features
------------

ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy extension and updated colcon plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Snapcraft 4.2 includes experimental support for Robot Operating System (ROS 2) `Foxy Fitzroy LTS <https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Releases/Release-Foxy-Fitzroy>`__ with a new :ref:`extension <the-ros2-foxy-extension>` and colcon plugin when used with :ref:`core20 <base-snaps>`.

For example, ROS 2 applications can now be built with a ``snapcraft.yaml`` as simple as:

.. code:: yaml

   name: ros2-talker-listener
   version: '0.1'
   summary: ROS2 Talker/Listener Example
   description: |
     This example launches a ROS2 talker and listener.

   grade: devel
   confinement: strict
   base: core20

   parts:
     ros-demos:
       plugin: colcon
       source: https://github.com/ros2/demos.git
       source-branch: foxy
       source-subdir: demo_nodes_cpp
       build-packages: [make, gcc, g++]
       stage-packages: [ros-foxy-ros2launch]

       extensions: [ros2-foxy]

For a walkthrough on how to work with the plugin and extension, see https://snapcraft.io/blog/how-to-build-a-snap-using-ros-2-foxy.

Ninja file generation with cmake
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the :ref:`cmake plugin <the-cmake-plugin>` creates a Makefile when used with with :ref:`core20 <base-snaps>` . This release adds the ``cmake-generator`` plugin property to optionally generate of a Ninja file:

.. code:: yaml

   hello:
       source: .
       plugin: cmake
       cmake-parameters:
         - -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
       cmake-generator: Ninja

List channel tracks from Snapcraft
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can now view the available `channel tracks <https://snapcraft.io/docs/using-tracks>`__ for a given snap with the new ``snapcraft list-tracks <snap-name>`` command (or with its alias, *tracks*).

The command output shows a list of tracks together with their status, creation date, and assigned version pattern, which is required by a given snap revision to be able to release to a given track:

.. code:: bash

   Name    Status    Creation-Date    Version-Pattern
   latest  default   -                -

*Status* can be one of the following:

* default (implicit active)
* active
* hidden
* closed
