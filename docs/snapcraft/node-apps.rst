Node apps
=========

*Node.js* has the ``package.json`` format and *npm* or *yarn* to assist in packaging and distributing applications to other developers. But these are not user-oriented tools. Nor do they offer a solution for notifying users of available updates.

Snaps address these gaps while building upon the work you‚Äôve already done to teach Node how to package your app.

Why are snaps good for Node.js projects?
----------------------------------------

-  **Snaps are easy to discover and install** Millions of users can browse and install snaps graphically in the Snap Store or from the command-line.
-  **Snaps install and run the same across Linux** They bundle the exact version of whatever is required, along with all of your app‚Äôs dependencies, be they modules or system libraries.
-  **Snaps automatically update to the latest version** Four times a day, users‚Äô systems will check for new versions and upgrade in the background.
-  **Upgrades are not disruptive** Because upgrades are not in-place, users can keep your app open as it‚Äôs upgraded in the background.
-  **Upgrades are safe** If your app fails to upgrade, users automatically roll back to the previous revision.

Build a snap in 20 minutes
--------------------------

Ready to get started? By the end of this guide, you‚Äôll understand how to make a snap of your Node.js app that can be published in the `Snap Store <https://snapcraft.io/store>`__, showcasing it to millions of Linux users.

   ‚Ñπ For a brief overview of the snap creation process, including how to install *snapcraft* and how it‚Äôs used, see :ref:`Snapcraft overview <snapcraft-overview>`. For a more comprehensive breakdown of the steps involved, take a look at :ref:`Creating a snap <creating-a-snap>`.

Getting started
---------------

Snaps are defined in a single YAML file placed in the root folder of your project. The following example shows the entire *snapcraft.yaml* file for an existing project, `Wethr <https://github.com/snapcraft-docs/wethr>`__. Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll break this down.

.. code:: yaml

   name: wethr
   version: git
   summary: Command line weather tool.
   description: |
     Get current weather:-
       $ wethr
     Get current weather in metric units
       $ wethr --metric
     Get current weather in imperial units
       $ wethr --imperial

   confinement: strict
   base: core20

   apps:
     wethr:
       command: bin/wethr

   parts:
     wethr:
       plugin: npm
       npm-node-version: 14.16.1
       source: .

Metadata
~~~~~~~~

The ``snapcraft.yaml`` file starts with a small amount of human-readable metadata, which usually can be lifted from the GitHub description or project README.md. This data is used in the presentation of your app in the Snap Store.

.. code:: yaml

   name: wethr
   version: git
   summary: Command line weather tool.
   description: |
     Get current weather:-
       $ wethr
     Get current weather in metric units
       $ wethr --metric
     Get current weather in imperial units
       $ wethr --imperial

The ``name`` must be unique in the Snap Store. Valid snap names consist of lower-case alphanumeric characters and hyphens. They cannot be all numbers. They also cannot start or end with a hyphen.

By specifying ``git`` for the version, the current git tag or commit will be used as the version string. Versions carry no semantic meaning in snaps.

The ``summary`` can not exceed 79 characters. You can use a chevron ‚Äò>‚Äô in the ``description`` key to declare a multi-line description.

Base
~~~~

The base keyword declares which *base snap* to use with your project. A base snap is a special kind of snap that provides a run-time environment alongside a minimal set of libraries that are common to most applications:

.. code:: yaml

   base: core20

As used above, `core20 <https://snapcraft.io/core20>`__ is the current standard base for snap building and is based on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS <http://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/>`__.

See :ref:`Base snaps <base-snaps>` for more details.

Security model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next section describes the level of confinement applied to your app.

.. code:: yaml

   confinement: strict

Snaps are containerised to ensure more predictable application behaviour and greater security. Unlike other container systems, the shape of this confinement can be changed through a set of interfaces. These are declarations that tell the system to give permission for a specific task, such as accessing a webcam or binding to a network port.

It‚Äôs best to start a snap with the confinement in warning mode, rather than strictly applied. This is indicated through the ``devmode`` keyword. When a snap is in devmode, runtime confinement violations will be allowed but reported. These can be reviewed by running ``journalctl -xe``.

Because devmode is only intended for development, snaps must be set to strict confinement before they can be published as ‚Äústable‚Äù in the Snap Store. Once an app is working well in devmode, you can review confinement violations, add appropriate interfaces, and switch to strict confinement.

Parts
~~~~~

Parts define what sources are needed to assemble your app. Parts can be anything: programs, libraries, or other needed assets. We‚Äôll deal with libraries and other assets later, so for now we just have one part: the wethr source code.

.. code:: yaml

   parts:
     wethr:
       plugin: npm
       npm-node-version: 14.16.1
       source: .

The :ref:`npm plugin <the-npm-plugin>` builds upon the work you‚Äôve already done to describe your app‚Äôs dependencies in your package.json. It will automatically include these in your snap.

The plugin also needs to know which version of Node to bundle. This is specified with the ``npm-node-version`` keyword.

Apps
~~~~

Apps are the commands you want to expose to users and any background services your application provides. Each key under ``apps`` is the command name that should be made available on users‚Äô systems.

The ``command`` specifies the full path to the binary to be run. This is resolved relative to the root of your snap contents.

.. code:: yaml

   apps:
     wethr:
       command: bin/wethr

If your command name matches the snap ``name``, users will be able run the command directly. If the names differ, then apps are prefixed with the snap ``name`` (``wethr.command-name``, for example). This is to avoid conflicting with apps defined by other installed snaps.

You can request an alias on the `Snapcraft forum <https://snapcraft.io/docs/process-for-aliases-auto-connections-and-tracks>`__ if your command name and snap name do not match but you don‚Äôt want your command prefixed. These aliases are set up automatically when your snap is installed from the Snap Store.

Building the snap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can download the example repository with the following command:

.. code:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/snapcraft-docs/wethr

After you‚Äôve created the *snapcraft.yaml* (or use the one provided), you can build the snap by simply executing the *snapcraft* command in the project directory:

.. code:: bash

   $ snapcraft
   Launching a container.

The resulting snap can be installed locally. This requires the ``--dangerous`` flag because the snap is not signed by the Snap Store. The ``--devmode`` flag acknowledges that you are installing an unconfined application:

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo snap install wethr_*.snap --devmode --dangerous

You can then try it out:

.. code:: bash

   $ wethr
   London, GB: 17.04C üåß

Removing the snap is simple too:

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo snap remove wethr

You can also clean up the build environment, although this will slow down the next initial build:

.. code:: bash

   $ snapcraft clean

By default, when you make a change to snapcraft.yaml, snapcraft only builds the parts that have changed. Cleaning a build, however, forces your snap to be rebuilt in a clean environment and will take longer.

Publishing your snap
--------------------

To share your snaps you need to publish them in the Snap Store. First, create an account on `the dashboard <https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/dev/account/>`__. Here you can customise how your snaps are presented, review your uploads and control publishing.

You‚Äôll need to choose a unique ‚Äúdeveloper namespace‚Äù as part of the account creation process. This name will be visible by users and associated with your published snaps.

Make sure the ``snapcraft`` command is authenticated using the email address attached to your Snap Store account:

.. code:: bash

   $ snapcraft login

Reserve a name for your snap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can publish your own version of a snap, provided you do so under a name you have rights to. You can register a name on `dashboard.snapcraft.io <https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/register-snap/>`__, or by running the following command:

.. code:: bash

   $ snapcraft register mynodesnap

Be sure to update the ``name:`` in your ``snapcraft.yaml`` to match this registered name, then run ``snapcraft`` again.

Upload your snap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use snapcraft to push the snap to the Snap Store.

.. code:: bash

   $ snapcraft upload --release=edge mynodesnap_*.snap

If you‚Äôre happy with the result, you can commit the snapcraft.yaml to your GitHub repo and `turn on automatic builds <https://build.snapcraft.io>`__ so any further commits automatically get released to edge, without requiring you to manually build locally.

Congratulations! You‚Äôve just built and published your first Node snap. For a more in-depth overview of the snap building process, see :ref:`Creating a snap <creating-a-snap>`.
