Using the Snap Store
====================

To access the Snap Store, go to https://snapcraft.io/store and either :ref:`create a developer account <create-a-developer-account>` or login with your developer account credentials.

   ℹ For larger projects and ISVs, it might be useful to also `create a brand account <https://snapcraft.io/docs/t/creating-snap-store-brand-accounts/6271>`__ in the name of the aroject or company.

After a snap has been :ref:`created <creating-a-snap>`, tested, and :ref:`released <releasing-your-app>` to the `Snap Store`_, the Store’s web interface can be used to perform the following functions:

-  :ref:`edit metadata <store-listing-and-branding-metadata>` to make a snap easily discoverable
-  :ref:`add media <store-listing-and-branding-media>` to show off your application and its brand
-  :ref:`manage releases <release-management>` and channels
-  :ref:`track installation <snap-store-metrics>` and usage statistics
-  `control who can see a snap <public-private-unlisted-snaps_>`_ with public, private and unlisted visibility

..

   ℹ Every device using the Snap Store has access to the same catalogue of software. A `Dedicated Snap Store <https://docs.ubuntu.com/core/en/build-store/>`__, however, allows vendors running Ubuntu Core and snap-based devices to control exactly what snaps are available, and when.
