Release notes: Snapcraft 3.1
============================

These are the release notes for `Snapcraft 3.1 <https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/releases/tag/3.1>`__, a minor release that builds on the foundations of :ref:`Snapcraft 3.0 <release-notes-snapcraft-3-0>`.

For general details, including installation instructions, see :ref:`Snapcraft overview <snapcraft-overview>`, or take a look at :ref:`Snapcraft release notes <snapcraft-release-notes>` for other *Snapcraft* releases.

Build environments
------------------

When using the :ref:`base <base-snaps>` keyword, it is once again possible to clean parts:

.. code:: bash

   $ snapcraft clean <part-name>

Cleaning individual steps from a specific part, by adding ``--step`` to ``clean``, is being redesigned to be more intuitive and straightforward in its use.

New *core* features
-------------------

``before`` and ``after``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``before`` and ``after`` keywords can now be used to order service launching within a snap.

AppStream extractor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `AppStream <https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/>`__ metadata extractor can now properly handle tags inside the relevant nodes and properly filter ``xml:lang``.

Taking the following AppStream metadata as an example input:

.. code:: xml

     <description>
       <p>List:</p>
       <p xml:lang="es">Lista:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>First item.</li>
         <li xml:lang="es">Primer item.</li>
         <li>Second item.</li>
         <li xml:lang="es">Segundo item.</li>
       </ul>
     </description>

â€¦would generate the following desription in ``snap.yaml``:

.. code:: yaml

   List:

   - First item.
   - Second item.

Additionally, desktop files are now properly found from either the AppStream ``launchable`` entries, or by falling back to legacy mode and inferring the desktop file from the appstream ``id``.

Plugins
-------

cmake
~~~~~

The plugin can now use ``build-snaps`` within the build environment. When any given ``build-snaps`` entry exists for a part that uses the ``cmake`` plugin, the plugin will make use of ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` so that libraries and headers from that snap are preferred.

Additionally, ``cmake`` primitives are now used to drive the build instead of just calling ``make``.

These features have already been used to create an initial set of KDE applications leveraging ``core18`` as a base as described on the `KDE apps at the snap of your fingers <https://snapcraft.io/blog/kde-apps-at-the-snap-of-your-fingers>`__ article.

rust
~~~~

The ``rust`` plugin has been refactored in a backwards compatible way to work better with the non-legacy ``rustup`` tool.

Platform updates
----------------

macOS
~~~~~

When using ``snapcraft`` with Homebrew for the first time, if ``multipass`` is not found, the user will be prompted to install it before proceeding.
