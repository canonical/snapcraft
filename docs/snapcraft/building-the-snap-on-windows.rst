Building the snap on Windows
============================

.. note::
          **NOTE TO EDITORS**

          This topic contributes to a new set of snap documentation. See `Proposed new documentation outline <https://snapcraft.io/docs/proposed-new-documentation-outline-page-deprecated>`__ for further details.



Now that you have a :ref:`snapcraft.yaml <creating-a-snap>` describing how to assemble your app and dependencies, you can build a snap.

The Microsoft Store contains an installable (WSL) Windows Subsystem for Linux containing Ubuntu 16.04.2. Once installed, users can run some Linux binaries under Windows.

.. note::
          ⚠ While it is possible to build, publish and release snaps using WSL, it’s not currently possible to install or run them in that environment.

Snapcraft, the command-line tool for building snaps, is distributed in the Ubuntu repository, which is accesible under WSL. Be sure to `install WSL <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10>`__, choosing Ubuntu before continuing.

Once installed, run WSL from the Windows Start menu.

Next, install snapcraft:

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt install snapcraft

Navigate to the project directory on your Windows host where the ``snapcraft.yaml`` file exists and run snapcraft.

.. code:: bash

   snapcraft

.. note::
          ⓘ If you are working with an Electron app, you will use the snapcraft tool for publishing to the Snap Store but not for building your snap. Electron apps do not have a snapcraft.yaml file.

          :ref:`Follow this guide <electron-apps>` to build a snap of an Electron app using electron-builder.

If the snap build completes successfully, you will find a ``.snap`` file in the same directory that you ran the snapcraft command. You can inspect its contents to ensure it contains all of your application’s assets:

::

   unsquashfs -l *.snap
