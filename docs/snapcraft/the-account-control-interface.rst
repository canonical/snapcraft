The account-control interface
=============================

``account-control`` allows managing non-system user accounts on `Ubuntu Core <https://ubuntu.com/core/docs>`__ systems.

This interface enables the management of the ``extrausers`` table in the Name Service Switch (NSS) databases on Ubuntu Core to manage both non-system unprivileged and privileged users and groups.

The interface **does not** allow the management of users and groups for the system NSS databases in */etc*.

Due to the privileged nature of access enabled by this interface, its use is reserved exclusively for “management snaps” from :ref:`brand stores <glossary-brand-store>`.

.. note::


          See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
