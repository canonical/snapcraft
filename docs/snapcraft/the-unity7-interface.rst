The unity7 interface
====================

``unity7`` allows interacting with Unity 7 services.

**Auto-connect**: yes

**Transitional**: yes

This interface grants privileged access to the user’s session because the Unity 7 environment does not prevent eavesdropping or apps interfering with one another.

See :ref:`The desktop interfaces <the-desktop-interfaces>` for further details.

**Condition to Connect**: If your snap has a graphical user interface and is expected to be launched on Unity desktop environment(the default DE on Ubuntu 16.04), you *should* connect this interface.

   ⓘ This is a snap interface. See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
