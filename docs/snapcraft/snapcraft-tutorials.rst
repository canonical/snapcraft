          **NOTE TO EDITORS**

          This topic is currently under construction as we start to migrate our current documentation to use the `Diátaxis <https://diataxis.fr/>`__ framework.

          See `Diátaxis, a new foundation for Canonical documentation <https://ubuntu.com/blog/diataxis-a-new-foundation-for-canonical-documentation>`__ for more details.



This section of our documentation contains step-by-step tutorials to help you learn how to build snap packages of your applications and services, for desktop, servers and embedded devices.

Our tutorials have been written to make as few assumptions as possible, and to be accessible to everyone. They’re an ideal place to start learning about snapcraft.

If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with Snapcraft, our How-to guides have more in-depth detail than our tutorials and can be applied to a broader set of applications. They’ll help you achieve an end-result but may require you to understand and adapt the steps to fit your specific requirements.

Take a look at our *Reference section* when you need to know which interfaces can be used and what plugins Snapcraft supports.

Finally, for a better understanding of how Snapcraft works, and how it can be used and configured, our *Explanation* section enable you to expand your knowledge and become better at building snaps with Snapcraft.
