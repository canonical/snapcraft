Snapcraft quickstart
====================

This quickstart *how-to* will guide you through the steps required to **create**, **build** and **publish** your own **snap package** with the *snapcraft* command line tool.

The purpose of this how-to is to provide Linux developers, packagers, and users with a basic and intermediate knowledge of how to package applications as snaps. It covers the following:

-  an overview of the snap ecosystem
-  a detailed explanation of the Snapcraft tool and its usage
-  the syntax and components of the build recipe for snaps (the *snapcraft.yaml* file)
-  the process of uploading a built snap into the Snap Store

Hereâ€™s what you need
--------------------

-  a basic understanding of Linux and the command line
-  `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS <https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/>`__, or later, installed
-  10GB of free storage space
-  access to the internet

The above requirements are specific to this tutorial. Other distributions can be used, and other platforms are supported. See `Installing snapd <https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd>`__ for details.
