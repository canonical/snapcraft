The audio-playback interface
============================

The ``audio-playback`` interface allows a snap to play sounds and music, via the supporting audio service running on the system, such as PulseAudio. Itâ€™s used by many applications and utilities, and as such, is enabled by default.

Audio recording is enabled with the companion :ref:`audio-record <the-audio-record-interface>` interface, and unlike ``audio-playback``, is not enabled (auto-connected) by default.

Example
-------

The `VLC snap`_ is a good example of an application using the audio-playback interface:

.. code:: bash

   $ snap connections vlc
   Interface               Plug                        Slot                     Notes
   audio-playback          vlc:audio-playback          :audio-playback          -
   audio-record            vlc:audio-record            -                        -

If for some reason you want to disable audio playback for a snap, use the disconnect command:

.. code:: bash

   snap disconnect vlc:audio-playback

The connect command can be used to re-enable audio playback:

.. code:: bash

   snap connect vlc:audio-playback

.. note::


          See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
