The ssh-keys interface
======================

``ssh-keys`` allows a user’s SSH (Secure Socket Shell) configuration to be read, along with both their public *and* private keys.

**Auto-connect**: no

Requires snapd version *2.31+*.

   ⓘ This is a snap interface. See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
