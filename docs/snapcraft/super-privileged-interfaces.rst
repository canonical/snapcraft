Super-privileged interfaces
===========================

Interfaces allow (or deny) access to a resource outside of a snapâ€™s confinement. Generally, any snap can declare any :ref:`interface plug <interface-management-slots-plugs>`.

However, there is a limited set of interfaces that require extra scrutiny when their *plugs* are included in a snap. This is due to their permissive nature and the control and impact they potentially have over a system.

These interfaces are called **super-privileged**, and snaps that include plugs for super-privileged interfaces require specific `approval from the Store <https://snapcraft.io/docs/process-for-aliases-auto-connections-and-tracks>`__ before they can be distributed and installed.

The following interfaces are considered super-privileged:
