The flutter extension
=====================

There are currently four Flutter extensions. They each track a different `Flutter build release channel <https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter-build-release-channels>`__ to help with the creation of snaps that use the `Flutter UI toolkit <https://flutter.dev/>`__:

-  **flutter-stable** tracks Flutter’s stable channel
-  **flutter-beta** tracks Flutter’s beta channel
-  **flutter-master** tracks Flutter’s master channel
-  **flutter-dev** tracks Flutter’s dev channel

..

   ⓘ The Flutter extension does not currently support :ref:`core22 <base-snaps>`. Snaps using ``core22`` should instead use the :ref:`flutter <the-flutter-plugin>` plugin with the :ref:`gnome <the-gnome-extension>` extension.

Each Flutter extension uses the :ref:`gnome-3-28 extension <the-gnome-3-28-extension>` to provide many of the components needed to build Flutter desktop applications.

Use of the :ref:`flutter plugin <the-flutter-plugin>` is optional. The plugin drives the build process while the extension handles its dependencies.

   ℹ Snapcraft extensions enable snap developers to easily incorporate a set of common requirements into a snap. See :ref:`Snapcraft extensions <snapcraft-extensions>` for further details.


.. _the-flutter-extension-heading--how:

Using the extensions
--------------------

Each Flutter extension works with the ``core18`` base snap (see :ref:`Base snaps <base-snaps>` for details). To use either extension, add ``extensions: [flutter-master]`` or ``extensions: [flutter-dev]`` to the application definition in your :ref:`snapcraft.yaml <creating-snapcraft-yaml>` file. For instance:

.. code:: yaml

   apps:
       tali:
           extensions: [flutter-master]
           command: usr/bin/tali
   [...]

See :ref:`Flutter applications <flutter-applications>` for a comprehensive overview of using extensions with Flutter applications.


.. _the-flutter-extension-heading--plugs:

Interface connections
---------------------

The following plugs are provided by either extension and implicitly included in your snapcraft.yaml:

.. code:: yaml

   plugs:
       gtk-3-themes:
           interface: content
           target: $SNAP/data-dir/themes
           default-provider: gtk-common-themes
       icon-themes:
               interface: content
               target: $SNAP/data-dir/icons
               default-provider: gtk-common-themes
       sound-themes:
               interface: content
               target: $SNAP/data-dir/sounds
               default-provider: gtk-common-themes
       platform_snap:
               interface: content
               target: $SNAP/gnome-platform

Your app may still need additional plugs, but you can expect the following plugs to be automatically available to your apps as well:

::

   plugs: [ desktop, desktop-legacy, gsettings, opengl, wayland, x11 ]

See :ref:`Adding interfaces <adding-interfaces>` for more details.
