The gpio-memory-control interface
=================================

``gpio-memory-control`` allows write access to all GPIO memory, via ``/dev/gpiomem``. This interface is restricted because it provides privileged access to all GPIO devices.

**Auto-connect**: no

Requires snapd version *2.24+*.

   â“˜ This is a snap interface. See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
