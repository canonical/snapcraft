The mount-observe interface
===========================

``mount-observe`` enables a snap to read mount table and quota information. This interface is restricted because it gives privileged read access to mount arguments and should only be used with trusted apps.

**Auto-connect**: no

   â“˜ This is a snap interface. See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
