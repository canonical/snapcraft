The physical-memory-control interface
=====================================

``physical-memory-control`` allows write access the to physical address space via the ``/dev/mem`` device.

When the kernel is compiled with ``STRICT_DEVMEM=y`` (required for certified kernels), accessible memory is an architecture-specific subset for common use cases, such as (eg, X without KMS, DOSBox, etc).

This interface can write to all physical memory when the kernel is compiled with ``STRICT_DEVMEM=n``.

**Auto-connect**: no

Requires snapd version *2.21+*.

   â“˜ This is a snap interface. See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
