**Type:** ``dict``

apps.<app-name>
---------------
The name exposed to run a program inside the snap.

**Type:** ``dict``

apps.<app-name>.adapter
-----------------------
Controls the creation of an env variable wrapper. **Type** ``enum`` Can be one of the following:

- ``none``
- ``full`` *(default)*

Snapcraft normally creates a wrapper holding common environment variables. Disabling this could be useful for minimal base snaps without a shell, and for statically linked binaries with no use for an environment.

.. _snapcraft-yaml-after:

apps.<app-name>.after
---------------------
Lists the applications a daemon is to be started after.

**Type:** ``list[string]``

Requires *daemon* to be set in app metadata. See also ``before`` (below) and :ref:`services-and-daemons` for more details.

apps.<app-name>.autostart
-------------------------

**Type:** ``string``

The desktop file is placed in ``SNAP_USER_DATA/.config/autostart``, and the application is started using the app’s command wrapper. See :ref:`snapcraft-parts-metadata` for further details.

apps.<app-name>.before
----------------------
Lists the applications a daemon is to be started before.

**Type** ``list[string]``

Requires ``daemon`` to be set in app metadata. See also :ref:`snapcraft-yaml-after` and :ref:`services-and-daemons` for more details.

apps.<app-name>.command

**Type:** ``string``

The command can be in either a snap runtime's command path, ``$SNAP/usr/sbin:$SNAP/usr/bin:$SNAP/sbin:$SNAP/bin``, or an executable path relative to ``$SNAP``.

If daemon is set, this will be the command to run the service.

Only a snap with *classic* confinement can use a relative path because the ``PATH`` environment variable isn't modified by a wrapper in classic confinement. See :ref:`classic-confinement` for more details.

**Examples:** ``app-launch`` for an executable placed under ``$SNAP/bin``. With ``classic`` confinement, ``bin/app-launch`` for an executable placed under ``$SNAP/bin``.

**Note:** The command must consist only of alphanumeric characters, spaces, and the following special characters: / . _ # : $ -.  If other characters are required, a wrapper script should be used for the command.

apps.<app-name>.command-chain
-----------------------------
A list of commands to be executed prior to ``apps.<app-name>.command``.

**Type:** ``string``

The list is executed, in order, before running the ``apps.<app-name>.command``.

- ``notify``: the command configured will send a signal to systemd to indicate that it's running.  See :ref:`services-and-daemons` for further details.

apps.<app-name>.desktop
-----------------------
Location of the ``.desktop`` file.

**Type:** ``string``

A path relative to the *prime* directory pointing to a desktop file, commonly used to add an application to the launch menu. Snapcraft will take care of the rest.
