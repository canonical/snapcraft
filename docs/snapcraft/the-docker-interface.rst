The docker interface
====================

``docker`` allows client access to Docker socket. Use this interface when you want to interact with the Docker daemon.

:ref:`Auto-connect <interface-management-auto-connections>`: no

:ref:`Super-privileged <super-privileged-interfaces>`: yes

For distribution via the `Snap store <https://snapcraft.io/store>`__, consumers of this interface require an approved `snap declaration <https://snapcraft.io/docs/process-for-aliases-auto-connections-and-tracks>`__.

   â“˜ This is a snap interface. See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
