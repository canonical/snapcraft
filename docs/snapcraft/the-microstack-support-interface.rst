The microstack-support interface
================================

The ``microstack-support`` interface enables multiple service access for the *Microstack infrastructure*. Itâ€™s used by the `Microstack <https://microstack.run/>`__ snap, a full OpenStack deployment within a single snap package.

Virtual machines are spawned as QEMU processes with libvirt acting as a management daemon (including for activities such as applying AppArmor profiles).

Networking is provided largely via OpenVSwitch and Neutron, with dnsmasq acting as an auxiliary daemon. A tun/tap kernel module is used for creating virtual interfaces.

Virtual machines rely on KVM for virtualisation acceleration and the vhost framework in the kernel (vhost_net, vhost_scsi, vhost_vsock).

.. note::

          See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
