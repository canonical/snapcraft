The ant plugin
==============

The ``ant`` plugin is useful for `Apache Ant <https://ant.apache.org/>`__-based parts and is commonly used to build Java projects with the `Ant snap <https://snapcraft.io/ant>`__.

This plugin installs the specified version of *ant* and runs the configured build. Any jar files created by the build inside the target directory, directly inside the root of the source tree, will be copied to ``${SNAP}/jar`` in the resulting archive.

``CLASSPATH`` will be set to the list of jars in ``${SNAP}/jar`` and ``bin/java`` is available as a symlink to the installed version of OpenJDK.

This plugin uses the common plugin keywords as well as those for “sources”. For more information, see :ref:`Snapcraft parts metadata <snapcraft-parts-metadata>`.

This plugin is only available to *core22* and *core18* based snaps. See :ref:`Base snaps <base-snaps>` for details.
