The npm plugin
==============

The npm plugin is useful when working with `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/>`__ and `npm <https://www.npmjs.com/>`__ JavaScript based parts.

This plugin can only be used with a :ref:`base <base-snaps>` of ``core22`` and ``core20``. For ``core18`` and ``core``, use the :ref:`nodejs <the-nodejs-plugin>` plugin instead.

The plugin uses *node* to install dependencies from ``package.json``. It also sets up binaries defined in ``package.json`` by adding them to ``PATH``.

This plugin uses the common plugin keywords as well as those for “sources”. For more information, see :ref:`Snapcraft parts metadata <snapcraft-parts-metadata>`.

Plugin-specific features and syntax are dependent on which :ref:`base <base-snaps>` is being used, as outlined below:

-  `base: core22 <the-npm-plugin-heading--core22_>`__
-  `base: core20 <the-npm-plugin-heading--core20_>`__

See `Node applications <https://snapcraft.io/docs/node-apps>`__ for a simple example, or search `GitHub <https://github.com/search?q=path%3Asnapcraft.yaml+%22plugin%3A+npm%22&type=Code>`__ for projects already using the plugin.

   ⓘ This is a *snapcraft* plugin. See :ref:`Snapcraft plugins <snapcraft-plugins>` and :ref:`Supported plugins <supported-plugins>` for further details on how plugins are used.
