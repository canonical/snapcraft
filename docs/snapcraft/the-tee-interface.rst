The tee interface
=================

The ``tee`` interface permits access to Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) devices via the `TEE subsystem <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/staging/tee.html>`__ in the Linux kernel.

This interface is primarily intended to be used with :ref:`glossary-ubuntu-core`.

.. note::


          See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
