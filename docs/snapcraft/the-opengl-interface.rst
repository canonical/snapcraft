The opengl interface
====================

``opengl`` allows access to the OpenGL stack and, consequently, OpenGL hardware, which may be needed for certain types of graphical applications and those that use `CUDA <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA>`__ libraries for computation. See :ref:`Adding OpenGL/GPU support to a snap <adding-opengl-gpu-support-to-a-snap>` for more information on how to use this interface.

**Auto-connect**: yes

   â“˜ This is a snap interface. See :ref:`Interface management <interface-management>` and :ref:`Supported interfaces <supported-interfaces>` for further details on how interfaces are used.
