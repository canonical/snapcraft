Adding parts
============

When building a snap with :ref:`Snapcraft <snapcraft-overview>`, parts are used to describe your application, where its various components can be found, its build and run-time requirements, and those of its dependencies. Consequently, a snap always has one or more parts.

A part’s definition within :ref:`snapcraft.yaml <the-snapcraft-yaml-schema>` is purposely flexible to allow for varied and disparate sources.

At its simplest, a part will locate a project’s source code and to invoke a :ref:`plugin <snapcraft-plugins>` to build and deploy the consequent application within your snap environment. But a part can equally be used to source and unpack a binary executable from an RPM file, or override into the correct location.

A part can also download tagged code from a remote repository, pull in dependencies, define a build order, and completely override both the *snapcraft build* and the *snapcraft stage* phases of the process.

For more details on how parts are built within the *snapcraft* environment, including build stages and the directories they use, see :ref:`Parts lifecycle <parts-lifecycle>`.

Defining a part
---------------

The ``snapcraft init`` command creates the following *part* template in *snapcraft.yaml*:

.. code:: yaml

   parts:
     my-part:
       # See 'snapcraft plugins'
       plugin: nil

A part starts with an arbitrary name, such as ``my-part``, which is followed by enough :ref:`Snapcraft parts metadata <snapcraft-parts-metadata>` to build the functionality you require.

The core of a typical part will commonly consist of the following metadata:

-  **plugin** Used to simplify and accelerate your build on commonly used frameworks and platforms. A plugin will often add, and may require, its own additional metadata. See :ref:`Snapcraft plugins <snapcraft-plugins>` for more details. Examples: ``python``, ``go``, ``java``, ``cmake``, ``autotools``
-  **source** The location of the file or files needed to build your part. It can refer to a directory tree, a compressed archive, or a revision control repository. Examples: ``.``, ``https://github.com/coderholic/pyradio.git``, ``gnu-hello.tar.gz``
-  **build-packages** A list of the packages required to build your part. Package names are those used by the build host’s package manager, such as *apt* or *dnf*. Examples: ``[pkg-config,  libncursesw5-dev, sed ]``
-  **build-snaps** A list of the snaps required to build your part. Snap names can include `track and channel <https://snapcraft.io/docs/channels>`__ options (``<track>/<risk>/<branch>``). Examples: ``[go/1.16/stable,  kde-frameworks-5-core18-sdk]``
-  **stage-packages** A list of the packages required by your part to *run*. Package names are those used by the build host’s package manager, such as *apt* or *dnf*. Examples: ``[gnome-themes-standard, libncursesw5, dbus]``
-  **stage-snaps** A list of the snaps required by your part to *run*. As with *build-snaps*, you can optionally add the `track and channel <snap-channels_>`_ of the snaps you wish to include. Examples: ``[ffmpeg-sdk-gplv3, codium/latest/stable]``

As per the `YAML specification`_, the members of a list in *snapcraft.yaml* can be formatted in either of the following ways:

.. code:: yaml

   build-packages: [g++, make, git, sed]

   build-packages:
   - g++
   - make
   - git
   - sed

For help on working out which packages you need for both building and staging your snap, take a look at :ref:`Build and staging dependencies <build-and-staging-dependencies>`, and see :ref:`Snapcraft parts metadata <snapcraft-parts-metadata>` for a complete list of supported *parts* keywords.

Parts can also be sourced from shell scripts outside of the *snapcraft.yaml*. See :ref:`Scriptlets <override-build-steps>` for details.
