# Client-side page redirects. Each mapping takes the format:
#     "<old path>" "<current path>"
# Paths must be represented as source files relative to the root of the `docs` dir.
# The old path must be a file that _doesn't exist_ in the source. The current path
# must be a file that _does exist_ in the source.
