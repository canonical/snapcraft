Tutorials
=========

The tutorials are guided lessons that help you develop skills by using Snapcraft. Each
is self-contained and delivers a working result that marks a learning milestone and is
an opportunity for further exploration. If you're a newcomer to Snapcraft, this is the
best way to start.

The first tutorial works through the process of packaging a snap with Snapcraft. It will
introduce you to key concepts and operations, from installation and setup to finalizing
your first snap.
