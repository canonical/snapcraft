Description: easily craft snaps
 Snapcraft aims to make upstream developers' lives easier and as such is not
 a single toolset, but instead is a collection of tools that enable the
 natural workflow of an upstream to be extended with a simple release step
 into Snappy.

Package: snapcraft-parser
Architecture: all
Depends: snapcraft (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}, ${python3:Depends}
Description: cloud parser for shared snapcraft parts.
 The parser is in charge of getting all the shared parts out there
 indexed into a common cacheable file. It processes multiple origin's
 specified in yaml documents and outputs `parts` which snapcraft can
 utilize.
